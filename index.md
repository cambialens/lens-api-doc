#### Version: `1.0`
This service allows you to access the full corpus of Lens scholarly works using the flexibility and convenience of an API. The API allows you to perform and combine several types of searches using a number of different operations. This API documentation provides a list of available request fields and describes several supported query types. A [Swagger UI] is available for query development and a GitHub repository is provided for issue tracking.

We have described several supported query types in the documentation, however the examples listed may not cover all applicable scenarios that you might want to use. If there are other scenarios that you would find useful, please [let us know](https://www.lens.org/lens/feedback?returnTo=https:/). As we receive feedback, we will update the documentation with new examples, and we will use your input to guide development and improve the API.

As we continue scaling up the Lens services, we welcome your [feedback](https://www.lens.org/lens/feedback?returnTo=https:/). We would love to hear how you use the Lens API and if you would like share a tutorial/blog about your use of the Lens, please let us know. And if you would like to help us design and build APIs and web services that better meet your needs, please take our survey.
