This service allows you to access the full corpus of Lens scholarly works and patent using the flexibility and convenience of a REST API. The versioned API allows you to perform and combine several types of searches using a number of different operations. This API documentation provides guidelines for getting you started with the API and details the request/response schema with examples. A [Swagger UI] is also provided for query development and a GitHub repository is provided for issue tracking.

We have described several supported query types and use cases in the documentation, however the examples listed may not cover all applicable scenarios that you might want to use. If there are other scenarios that you would find useful, please [let us know](https://www.lens.org/lens/feedback?returnTo=https:/). As we receive feedback, we will update the documentation with new examples, and we will use your input to guide development and improve the API.

We value your comments and feedback on the API via our API survey. If you or your library have not taken it yet, please [take our survey](https://lensorg.typeform.com/to/QM6aMm). For current API users, please follow the attribution requirements and make sure the Lens logo is visible on your website if you are using Lens data. For new users, upon completing the scholarly API request, please make sure to provide your full name, your organisation address (official email address as well please), and a comprehensive description of the intended use of the scholarly data.

You can request access to the Lens Scholarly API, Patent API or PatSeq Bulk Downloads, or manage your access plans and tokens from your [Lens user profile](https://www.lens.org/lens/user/subscriptions).
