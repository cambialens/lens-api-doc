The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On February 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that COVID-19 has a 79% genome sequence identity with SARS-CoV, the virus which caused a major outbreak in 2002–2003 when compared to MERS CoV. Even though some promising results have been achieved but Clinical studies of these candidate drugs need to be confirmed their safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Till then the spread may be controlled only by following the strict quarantine protocols and preventive measures as there is no effective drug available for the treatment at this moment. This article gives a bird’s eye view about the current knowledge on the diagnosis, treatment, &amp; prevention of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks.\nObjective: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe.\nMethods: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of “Coronavirus” were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\nResults: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases.\nConclusions: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in the beginning stages, it is essential to explore and combine new methods of disease surveillance to assist with the preparedness of health care systems at the regional level.","references_count":16,"scholarly_citations_count":98,"start_page":"e18941","scholarly_citations":["000-630-918-499-105","001-928-212-172-344","003-409-029-130-785","004-642-650-454-443","005-704-734-921-616","007-782-318-273-134","008-135-088-658-906","010-379-536-523-208","010-786-994-176-74X","011-392-855-866-104","012-198-531-839-641","012-422-855-593-055","014-063-324-915-810","014-966-561-268-941","015-561-289-544-978","016-601-168-458-280","017-035-153-011-868","018-516-761-882-134","022-868-769-737-058","023-025-340-529-927","024-925-081-588-681","025-849-699-557-670","026-159-377-689-396","026-638-707-992-493","026-751-509-766-14X","027-023-727-941-98X","029-247-430-761-860","029-350-217-609-187","032-096-445-304-534","032-101-711-078-589","033-239-286-307-528","033-825-613-680-322","034-214-560-715-715","034-343-345-018-942","034-868-416-784-233","035-228-043-304-540","036-237-600-527-247","037-073-577-553-962","037-982-960-089-822","040-871-116-814-538","041-681-736-396-954","045-472-341-032-261","045-865-156-283-453","046-014-322-677-396","046-414-906-195-510","046-864-089-929-286","048-906-450-419-435","052-584-807-220-214","052-776-650-489-560","052-799-427-472-901","055-011-040-687-660","055-483-367-341-384","057-537-713-941-440","058-329-697-507-686","062-177-795-906-597","063-117-998-652-138","063-174-375-688-477","064-257-975-479-652","065-029-726-432-046","066-577-917-147-583","069-729-474-364-931","073-921-329-426-379","077-820-406-042-807","078-739-274-032-188","080-474-549-380-597","081-337-560-880-053","083-456-036-413-285","083-569-662-958-937","084-995-159-922-02X","085-663-504-402-312","096-120-853-727-527","096-277-081-575-097","099-344-705-761-645","099-562-175-645-887","100-747-095-024-583","102-242-977-254-451","105-061-432-908-378","116-032-869-727-795","116-652-509-025-869","116-797-837-400-645","123-551-200-167-405","125-003-778-690-580","126-466-283-228-041","133-718-163-278-820","140-150-109-389-09X","144-455-433-237-47X","145-770-964-867-215","148-921-404-996-494","156-740-057-242-969","161-912-077-352-566","168-027-347-488-408","171-876-389-314-072","174-561-260-653-615","176-454-587-169-728","186-931-066-169-177","193-549-372-815-153","193-880-794-178-836","197-971-785-651-299"],"author_count":1,"is_open_access":true}

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems around the world, where resources have refocused on increasing critical bed capacity to prepare for the peak in incidence of COVID-19. Oncology faces an unprecedented challenge as patients require multidisciplinary care and are more likely to be immunosuppressed. Services in oncology have been transformed using minimal resources over a short period of time. This transformation continues and telemedicine is playing a key role. Aims We explore how services in oncology have transformed to deliver services including consultations, systemic anticancer therapy, and surgery for patients, while shielding them from contracting COVID-19. We assess the risks and benefits of the service transformation in the immediate, interim, and long term, and how telemedicine supports the process. Methods We performed a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and latest official data from May to June 2020. Results Through the published literature on this topic, we discuss the transformations in oncology and the impact on patients and healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reflect on the lessions from COVID-19 and assess the role of telemedicine in the future of oncology services. Conclusion Transformation of services in oncology effectively shields patients from COVID-19 infections, and telemedicine plays a role in virtual consultations. The long-term effects are yet to be seen, such as safety of home-based treatment, and effectiveness of virtual communication on patient care. As oncology requires a multidisciplinary approach, telemedicine will play a key role to improve patient-centered cancer care in the future.","references_count":31,"scholarly_citations_count":31,"start_page":"7161","end_page":"7171","scholarly_citations":["003-252-796-135-779","006-731-778-603-273","007-751-556-032-81X","008-853-132-361-381","010-056-112-491-322","011-153-344-096-621","012-233-242-994-232","013-113-935-576-201","020-446-955-208-798","021-893-524-629-161","022-169-593-225-557","032-065-469-984-763","039-314-795-852-984","040-509-639-351-315","040-916-885-571-944","043-758-567-732-958","044-045-206-430-328","058-758-954-855-477","059-510-676-006-260","059-934-165-159-360","061-102-038-674-538","064-178-208-459-065","069-968-235-809-030","091-536-479-668-068","093-241-587-478-75X","094-505-124-639-468","125-905-613-092-913","128-986-980-994-35X","174-951-847-842-101","183-128-498-606-850","190-017-682-950-637"],"author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}

Aims Diabetes mellitus has been reported to be one of the most prevalent comorbidity in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess the association of comorbid diabetes with COVID-19 severity or mortality in China. Methods We performed a systematic literature search from six electronic databases on diabetes and COVID-19. The outcome of interest was disease severity or mortality. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed by the Cochran Q test and the I2 statistic. A random effects model was applied to calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Nine studies from different provinces/cities were identified according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were a total of 1070 patients with diabetes, out of the 8807 COVID-19 cases. The majority of the cases were derived from Hubei Province. A low degree of heterogeneity in the risk estimates was observed in the included studies. Meta-analysis showed that there was a significant association of preexisting diabetes with disease severity or death. The pooled RR was 2.96 (95% CI: 2.31–3.79; p  Conclusions Comorbid diabetes was associated with an increased risk of disease severity or death in Chinese COVID-19 patients.","references_count":38,"scholarly_citations_count":36,"start_page":"108346","end_page":"108346","scholarly_citations":["000-053-817-430-304","000-122-955-027-632","000-224-357-676-218","002-664-391-016-266","004-225-825-287-644","005-172-990-346-556","008-568-065-967-881","015-860-773-681-907","018-392-850-094-445","019-435-044-228-326","020-248-767-044-864","020-494-680-453-327","035-701-034-727-817","042-651-193-723-961","043-426-473-386-918","044-214-678-459-684","045-102-983-934-242","045-948-786-836-431","049-355-796-462-404","050-539-629-207-918","055-914-549-360-465","055-916-754-558-568","056-675-602-228-123","063-825-971-349-283","065-429-755-105-24X","065-965-735-133-832","073-058-311-761-617","081-723-380-771-517","083-021-861-507-190","084-918-898-797-446","108-929-992-956-944","111-280-790-147-799","123-473-588-653-870","130-254-079-422-461","165-713-291-270-645","171-745-560-960-278"],"author_count":7,"is_open_access":true}

speaking, pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 can be divided into those acting on upstream pathways early on in the disease process via suppression of viral replication or by inhibiting cell entry, and those acting on downstream pathways later on via selective attenuation of the adaptive immune cytokine-mediated inflammatory response. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to shorten duration of disease while interferon beta-1b may speed up viral clearance. The results with hydroxychloroquine have thus far been rather disappointing. Trials with selective cytokine blockers including anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6), have shown some promise in more severe cases, with further confirmation being required from large-scale phase-3 randomised controlled trials. The likelihood is that combination therapy addressing both upstream and downstream pathways may be required to prevent progression of severe COVID-19 infection in susceptible older patients with comorbidities and we believe further studies are now warranted to specifically target such at-risk groups who are more prone to worse outcomes.","scholarly_citations_count":3,"start_page":"133","end_page":"137","scholarly_citations":["062-317-836-615-676","099-235-945-614-473","167-442-160-773-526"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

The information sources were taken from Pubmed, MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science, and RSCI systems. The data from retrospective and prospective clinical trials have been analyzed. This review presents current data on the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, mortality and prognosis of cancer patients infected with COVID-19, treatment options for COVID-19, as well as the case report of the cancer patient with rare atypical COVID-19 course of disease. To date, the groups of increased risk of being infected with a new coronavirus have been identified. These groups include cancer patients. Despite the pandemic, treatment of cancer patients must be continued, since the presence of a tumor process does not allow the therapy to be delayed. The world cancer community is actively continuing to develop recommendations for optimal management of cancer patients in the context of the pandemic. The most relevant of them are described in this article.","references_count":23,"scholarly_citations_count":4,"start_page":"5","end_page":"22","scholarly_citations":["004-981-215-735-888","032-795-423-954-870","053-624-119-865-625","115-163-606-486-006"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 is a major global health challenge. At the time of writing, over 11.6 million people around the world had been registered as infected and 538,000 had died (Worldometers, 2020, accessed July 7, 2020). Public health responses to COVID-19 need to balance direct efforts to control the disease and its impact on health systems, infected people, and their families with the impacts from associated mitigating interventions. Such impacts include social isolation, school closure, health service disruption stemming from reconfiguring health systems, and diminished economic activity. The primary focus of both the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has been on addressing COVID-19 as a physical health crisis, but the need to strengthen mental health action, including suicide prevention, is increasingly recognized, as is the need for mental health research to be an integral part of the recovery plan (UN, 2020a). The impacts of the pandemic on physical and mental health will unfold differently over time and will vary depending on the duration and fluctuating intensity of the disease. Research is needed to help ensure that decision-making regarding all aspects of health, including mental health (Holmes et al., 2020), is informed by the best quality data at each stage of the pandemic. The pandemic poses a prolonged and unique challenge to public mental health, with major implications for suicide and suicide prevention (Gunnell et al., 2020; Reger, Stanley, & Joiner, 2020). A rise in suicide deaths in the wake of the pandemic is not inevitable. There is consensus, however, that the mitigation of risk will be contingent upon a proactive and effective response involving collaborative work between the state, NGOs, academia, and local governments and coordinated leadership across government ministries, including health, education, security, social services, welfare, and finance. Countries have responded in different ways to the pandemic, effectively creating a series of natural experiments. Thus, regions of the world affected later in the pandemic can draw on lessons from countries, such as China and Italy, affected in its early phase. Likewise, lessons learned early in the pandemic (e.g., on the impact of lockdown and physical distancing measures) can be used to inform responses to any future surges in the incidence of COVID-19. Although there are important parallels between countries in the course of the pandemic, some stressors, responses, and priorities are likely to differ between high- and low–middle-income countries and between cultures and regions. As COVID-19 appears to be disproportionately affecting Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities, the response – and suicide prevention research carried out to inform the response – needs to be sufficiently granular and account for the complexity of risks in these groups (O'Connor et al., 2020). Throughout this editorial, when we refer to suicide and suicidal behavior, we mean to include both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors and self-harm.","references_count":36,"scholarly_citations_count":63,"start_page":"321","end_page":"330","scholarly_citations":["001-938-047-548-49X","002-216-550-256-103","004-341-325-445-376","004-903-525-981-634","007-839-666-049-440","008-357-825-632-647","008-400-272-334-906","010-110-711-370-033","011-461-199-644-04X","011-673-063-934-501","011-926-446-006-801","012-757-675-219-845","015-513-002-530-67X","017-588-390-010-789","018-676-528-915-30X","018-862-207-263-709","021-227-621-895-766","022-167-162-639-193","022-370-935-562-970","023-530-648-279-140","024-627-590-968-943","024-771-054-260-067","025-098-009-223-880","027-186-601-653-508","028-569-737-594-804","028-619-947-854-654","030-271-711-678-807","030-437-846-924-064","032-771-899-689-957","037-625-908-560-482","042-388-306-852-941","044-092-281-861-701","049-827-476-177-922","050-583-255-009-48X","052-508-425-274-677","059-967-225-194-151","062-012-028-646-354","062-700-732-415-583","066-762-756-866-775","073-494-782-044-586","074-885-843-929-359","076-838-906-926-210","080-102-241-609-546","085-755-399-080-232","096-615-502-575-642","098-459-160-827-854","103-990-939-546-795","106-365-717-326-493","110-943-504-332-239","112-547-635-994-484","118-199-304-783-99X","119-267-651-922-163","129-661-382-460-383","130-664-936-571-026","132-350-216-825-594","132-949-798-200-914","135-665-009-933-248","151-196-669-695-530","166-447-412-141-899","169-149-434-938-050","169-688-862-016-047","188-042-185-391-304","197-993-685-753-981"],"author_count":11,"is_open_access":true}

However, due to the limited amount of labelled medical images, automated classification of these images for positive and negative cases remains the biggest challenge in their reliable use in diagnosis and disease progression. We implemented a transfer learning pipeline for classifying COVID-19 chest X-ray images from two publicly available chest X-ray datasets1,2. The classifier effectively distinguishes inflammation in lungs due to COVID-19 and Pneumonia from the ones with no infection (normal). We have used multiple pre-trained convolutional backbones as the feature extractor and achieved an overall detection accuracy of 90%, 94.3%, and 96.8% for the VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0 backbones respectively. Additionally, we trained a generative adversarial framework (a CycleGAN) to generate and augment the minority COVID-19 class in our approach. For visual explanations and interpretation purposes, we implemented a gradient class activation mapping technique to highlight the regions of the input image that are important for predictions. Additionally, these visualizations can be used to monitor the affected lung regions during disease progression and severity stages.","references_count":30,"scholarly_citations_count":57,"start_page":"1010","end_page":"1021","scholarly_citations":["002-821-411-242-196","005-428-273-993-423","007-132-962-266-002","007-166-036-265-401","007-427-601-238-696","009-053-346-602-591","009-321-544-137-000","010-066-603-594-122","010-881-231-050-167","010-981-620-343-121","011-304-512-378-165","011-838-999-033-420","013-235-418-114-944","015-468-062-535-624","019-834-292-567-384","020-012-565-854-112","021-566-159-767-372","024-063-811-302-002","025-019-447-156-43X","025-377-047-297-209","028-448-871-730-896","029-714-056-619-337","042-938-723-658-422","043-697-035-066-249","047-761-628-072-459","049-283-007-125-967","052-114-860-924-804","058-738-629-581-291","059-010-299-626-956","065-084-433-898-020","068-919-267-384-762","073-996-288-518-299","077-404-105-189-925","081-293-210-946-372","083-003-541-141-039","094-453-009-089-040","097-521-468-289-958","098-209-206-858-014","101-698-556-949-465","109-167-993-966-421","116-941-969-430-137","119-659-096-698-352","127-140-646-402-704","135-654-059-567-385","139-405-135-234-725","142-032-523-690-369","145-936-551-974-757","148-760-262-739-091","152-771-196-536-664","153-098-246-237-11X","153-537-274-774-715","155-075-554-032-635","156-035-202-076-01X","161-336-368-823-775","166-056-737-623-441","167-323-231-130-746","176-732-382-310-705"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become globally widespread with millions of confirmed cases and many countries implementing various levels of quarantine. Therefore, it is important to investigate the psychological consequences of this process, given the unique situation that has been experienced globally. Therefore, the present study examined whether intolerance of uncertainty was related to mental wellbeing and whether this relationship was mediated by rumination and fear of COVID-19. The sample comprised 1772 Turkish individuals (aged between 18 and 73 years) from 79 of 81 cities in Turkey, who completed measures of mental wellbeing, intolerance of uncertainty, rumination, and fear of COVID-19. Results of serial mediation analyses showed that intolerance of uncertainty had a significant direct effect on mental wellbeing. Rumination and fear of COVID-19, in combination, serially mediated the association between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing. The findings are discussed within the framework of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and related literature.","references_count":45,"scholarly_citations_count":185,"start_page":"1","end_page":"12","scholarly_citations":["000-117-478-459-187","000-282-418-038-638","000-370-245-885-934","000-376-463-500-585","000-412-171-051-277","000-454-787-388-391","000-745-803-360-429","001-375-735-253-613","001-666-769-846-599","002-326-990-261-026","003-145-958-769-827","003-298-239-656-188","003-519-324-932-972","003-803-631-547-626","003-840-965-463-29X","004-060-332-936-623","004-271-917-198-937","004-402-767-436-182","004-865-124-790-146","005-626-241-264-549","005-737-893-383-967","005-881-877-285-634","006-678-371-986-794","006-900-559-334-40X","008-719-740-153-781","008-801-061-355-405","008-807-698-485-650","009-141-836-043-622","009-304-486-382-264","009-326-621-257-675","009-451-792-779-745","009-797-009-446-534","009-800-395-839-25X","010-056-037-951-260","010-183-197-399-235","010-593-052-272-323","011-496-150-204-860","012-122-134-463-90X","012-593-900-410-622","015-279-168-016-950","015-564-730-766-648","016-129-952-716-793","016-137-469-471-650","016-200-859-823-411","016-626-710-179-400","017-532-222-630-441","018-023-289-367-976","019-598-926-364-115","019-758-576-083-478","022-005-007-909-446","023-698-734-860-838","023-766-171-094-544","024-225-699-765-574","024-249-321-056-852","025-869-828-934-320","026-302-666-115-910","026-791-466-439-929","027-393-362-786-478","027-656-309-978-739","027-847-513-324-945","027-873-185-273-868","029-236-865-390-487","029-350-105-378-695","029-837-210-448-362","031-270-442-000-046","031-443-468-140-103","031-743-017-071-158","032-064-649-411-116","033-172-229-559-530","034-913-761-168-87X","035-822-986-117-38X","035-827-625-315-228","035-842-017-787-649","036-177-389-567-961","037-290-400-156-823","037-827-360-942-252","037-983-697-708-773","038-475-498-343-754","039-372-563-747-849","040-538-093-953-885","041-237-730-060-383","041-370-068-832-379","041-791-222-532-805","043-548-719-172-131","043-562-951-833-628","043-634-859-553-527","043-659-201-138-491","044-142-157-896-619","044-249-798-730-029","045-312-297-773-050","045-318-713-884-110","045-332-011-964-168","047-572-601-833-200","048-306-001-382-471","049-120-788-075-248","049-867-289-729-943","049-928-409-728-010","049-930-639-706-426","050-092-756-795-339","050-315-306-609-741","050-561-657-879-659","050-894-296-958-559","051-329-083-364-292","052-055-367-813-820","052-389-260-794-893","052-488-946-854-33X","053-575-960-177-146","053-782-368-927-245","053-855-740-277-651","054-718-232-905-637","055-793-331-311-03X","056-001-068-566-729","056-830-723-854-689","058-002-399-479-07X","058-091-125-991-655","058-658-769-730-72X","059-274-651-060-736","059-579-075-520-390","061-600-241-866-019","062-778-920-864-255","062-943-387-349-787","063-806-469-073-564","064-136-446-607-670","069-116-938-289-158","069-487-963-330-83X","071-056-756-305-081","073-473-721-386-619","074-379-361-284-648","076-070-239-783-264","078-844-791-600-846","078-978-272-856-43X","079-915-335-112-859","080-882-270-311-183","082-973-956-003-667","083-333-437-417-025","083-633-453-897-190","084-076-853-585-644","084-667-653-946-649","087-248-369-625-322","087-719-002-280-223","088-503-412-409-281","089-071-035-079-087","090-238-207-730-487","092-794-147-707-911","094-936-092-508-774","096-218-103-605-403","096-298-134-311-136","099-438-922-371-392","099-885-030-296-491","101-064-044-607-854","102-363-180-583-89X","107-202-897-894-665","109-269-098-237-879","110-236-289-895-633","111-048-127-808-400","111-880-275-020-08X","113-334-089-196-369","118-524-449-654-415","119-041-974-196-870","122-059-822-021-215","122-701-768-018-722","125-369-582-198-400","125-377-365-540-003","129-798-459-634-677","131-052-494-400-535","132-949-798-200-914","133-302-982-521-207","134-124-249-267-557","136-015-807-135-082","137-588-726-127-691","140-434-882-389-657","142-673-195-056-819","150-977-859-706-70X","154-075-798-048-100","154-539-372-924-540","156-994-982-605-894","157-335-633-888-352","161-455-066-935-925","163-834-288-814-486","172-082-814-920-199","181-093-258-142-321","187-632-339-867-234","191-336-606-800-527","191-899-639-239-579","193-531-700-737-401"],"author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}

To combat this pandemic, effective screening techniques for infected patients are indispensable. There is no doubt that the use of chest X-ray images for radiological assessment is one of the essential screening techniques. Some of the early studies revealed that the patient’s chest X-ray images showed abnormalities, which is natural for patients infected with COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a parallel-dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) based COVID-19 detection system from chest X-ray images, named as Parallel-Dilated COVIDNet (PDCOVIDNet). First, the publicly available chest X-ray collection fully preloaded and enhanced, and then classified by the proposed method. Differing convolution dilation rate in a parallel form demonstrates the proof-of-principle for using PDCOVIDNet to extract radiological features for COVID-19 detection. Accordingly, we have assisted our method with two visualization methods, which are specifically designed to increase understanding of the key components associated with COVID-19 infection. Both visualization methods compute gradients for a given image category related to feature maps of the last convolutional layer to create a class-discriminative region. In our experiment, we used a total of 2905 chest X-ray images, comprising three cases (such as COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia), and empirical evaluations revealed that the proposed method extracted more significant features expeditiously related to suspected disease. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance metrics: the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores reach $$96.58\\%$$\n , $$96.58\\%$$\n , $$96.59\\%$$\n and $$96.58\\%$$\n , respectively, which is comparable or enhanced compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We believe that our contribution can support resistance to COVID-19, and will adopt for COVID-19 screening in AI-based systems.","conference":{"name":"Health Information Science"},"references_count":35,"scholarly_citations_count":34,"start_page":"27","end_page":"27","scholarly_citations":["001-911-441-838-962","002-438-645-730-318","006-024-358-223-378","013-168-028-320-876","016-869-437-801-743","017-235-031-601-700","024-202-775-274-071","025-001-943-207-237","026-874-565-182-843","027-877-525-463-392","032-240-382-819-736","034-348-876-187-430","042-304-340-846-202","043-876-922-369-231","049-283-007-125-967","052-701-304-538-79X","052-879-080-281-910","053-279-200-036-192","060-179-136-624-373","065-084-433-898-020","076-403-764-078-179","079-672-309-464-187","087-983-040-461-714","094-453-009-089-040","096-188-190-612-518","102-977-126-650-015","133-071-154-539-22X","139-071-754-698-134","152-771-196-536-664","153-628-980-533-998","154-490-760-573-020","156-035-202-076-01X","187-371-334-594-588","192-603-044-112-393"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of −5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to −0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are −0.25, −0.20 and −3.51 years, respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years, there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to ‘build back better’.","references_count":16,"scholarly_citations_count":10,"start_page":"315","end_page":"320","scholarly_citations":["009-485-551-899-59X","009-506-780-142-929","025-305-535-096-673","030-061-292-658-979","044-725-774-312-628","050-151-053-906-941","051-877-275-815-382","056-398-532-823-556","061-582-789-249-335","068-813-280-541-245"],"author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}

The purpose of conducting this research is to predict the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia. Covid-19 cases in Indonesia on April 6, 2020, were 2235 cases spread in 34 Provinces. As many as 2491 cases in Indonesia, there were 192 patients recovered (including those treated, so they have natural antibodies in the end) while the total who died was 209 people. It is assumed that around 13% of the total cases have natural antibodies. This is also the case with SARS-CoV-2 and may explain why some individuals (perhaps those most recently able to recover from seasonal coronavirus infections) have asymptomatic infections. Finally, the theoretical concept of increasing herd immunity in pandemic and epidemic cases in Indonesia which aims to control COVID-19 still needs to be reviewed because it is seen from the mortality data that CFR COVID-19 is predicted to be around 8.39% of the population in Indonesia where the risk of death still available. The best alternative is to do a healthy lifestyle, social distancing, and waiting for the vaccine to be found.","references_count":8,"start_page":"21","end_page":"28","author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19 hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID- 19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human activities on the transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable (above 94%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the spread of COVID- 19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google Community Mobility Reports.","references_count":22,"scholarly_citations_count":54,"start_page":"4891","end_page":"4904","scholarly_citations":["000-855-498-226-449","002-407-877-741-540","005-150-044-666-812","007-307-718-201-145","008-010-347-746-048","008-134-541-245-743","012-251-532-364-57X","017-850-848-552-311","017-921-460-286-833","019-191-236-452-519","020-255-321-745-290","021-382-705-805-721","022-781-166-315-903","023-821-035-055-486","023-822-477-948-630","025-251-581-697-882","027-802-654-952-612","028-043-291-181-127","033-524-904-885-003","035-434-236-429-486","040-712-870-201-639","042-836-988-236-965","044-540-029-684-199","046-717-989-132-846","049-260-759-996-966","054-411-534-641-570","054-771-071-425-765","055-073-924-632-319","055-389-200-784-385","056-121-318-520-421","057-263-223-148-84X","058-049-688-582-91X","058-383-548-178-652","059-190-120-822-625","060-382-581-535-33X","060-462-698-571-289","061-623-832-112-851","061-943-054-229-30X","062-869-700-547-593","065-361-979-047-378","068-774-167-834-880","070-059-157-494-324","070-321-772-954-143","072-965-219-591-830","075-487-246-989-655","091-013-061-903-136","093-610-544-414-431","094-758-588-298-214","105-961-928-100-691","134-721-709-583-661","141-280-525-719-301","149-292-578-352-370","159-370-927-565-985","165-594-017-027-803"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

With the increasing number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Nigeria, the pandemic has led to massive public reactions. This data attempted to evaluate the knowledge, impacts, and government intervention during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a questionnaire shared via social media using a Snowball sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 387 responses was received. Results show that a significant number of respondents had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 modes of transmission, symptoms, and preventive measures. Respondents maintain personal hygiene as 67% wash their hands with soap. The pandemic has caused worry (65%), anxiety (42%), panic (35%), and depression (16%) among respondents, even as government intervention is seen as inadequate by 70%. There is a need for mental health support and increased information campaigns about COVID-19.","references_count":8,"scholarly_citations_count":4,"start_page":"106177","end_page":"106177","scholarly_citations":["013-954-818-484-865","044-609-389-005-375","139-541-468-047-748","163-390-397-519-748"],"author_count":5,"is_open_access":true}

Ainda nao ha tratamento ou vacina eficaz, entao os esforcos para reducao da transmissao sao foco do sistema de saude. Em epidemias de doencas contagiosas, profissionais de saude correm um risco maior do que a populacao em geral de se contaminar. Nesse contexto, o farmaceutico exerce papel importante no controle da transmissao da doenca e na atencao as necessidades da comunidade durante a crise, disseminando informacoes sobre a doenca, alem de monitorar reacoes advindas do uso de medicamentos. Sendo assim, o trabalho proposto visa detalhar a funcao do farmaceutico na linha de frente ao combate a COVID-19 e esclarecer seu envolvimento no controle e prevencao da pandemia. Para alcancar este objetivo, bases de dados, como Google Academico, Scielo, Science Direct e PubMed, foram utilizadas na busca de evidencias sobre o novo Coronavirus, bem como da atuacao dos farmaceuticos neste cuidado a populacao. Os unitermos utilizados foram: Coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pharmaceutical care, Healthcare workers. Desta forma, obteve-se informacoes de publicacoes entre os anos 2003 a 2020 para esta revisao. Com este estudo podemos inferir que farmacias se tornaram o primeiro contato de muitos individuos contaminados com o atendimento de saude especializado. Com isto, este profissional torna-se importante no controle do medo coletivo e da falta de informacao, que devem ser combatidos atraves de informacoes confiaveis, contribuindo para reducao da sobrecarga sobre o sistema de saude.","references_count":59,"scholarly_citations_count":2,"start_page":"161","end_page":"178","scholarly_citations":["028-542-841-975-666","054-526-525-753-394"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

COVID-19 e uma doenca causada pelo novo coronavirus e se tornou-se ameaca mundial pouco tempo apos seu surgimento na cidade chinesa de Wuhan. Desde Dezembro de 2019, diversas pesquisas estao sendo realizadas com o proposito de conter a disseminacao do virus e de se obter medidas de tratamento uteis no combate a pandemia. Com isso, o presente estudo volta-se para a analise das novas metodologias de carater terapeutico que estao sendo desenvolvidas mundialmente para o tratamento e prevencao da COVID-19. A presente revisao bibliografica foi realizada com os dados obtidos nas seguintes bases: SciELO, Medline, Scopus,  Up-to-Date, dentre outros recursos atuais e relevantes para a tematica, que foram publicados no primeiro trimestre do ano de 2020. Com esta abordagem foram identificadas diversas abordagens de tratamento ainda em desenvolvimento, com diferentes modelos, bem como mecanismo de acao de novas medidas terapeuticas e de imunizacao, sobretudo, as que utilizam soro, imunoglobulinas, anticorpos monoclonais, plasma de pacientes convalescentes e vacinas. O sistema de saude mundial urge pela criacao de uma vacina capaz de estabelecer a memoria imunologica na populacao. Novos estudos mostram-se promissores em relacao a essa criacao, todavia, as medidas profilaticas permanecem como prioridade maxima e indispensaveis.","start_page":"97","end_page":"108","author_count":14,"is_open_access":true}

The World Health Organization has been forced to declare a public health emergency due to the global outbreak of COVID-19. The concerns about the COVID-19 disease are the rapid increase in the number of patients as well as the number of deaths compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome disease. Given that there is a remarkable variability amongst people for COVID-19 infection, there really is the possibility that there will be genetic and environmental effects, it is a need for their role to be fully clarified as soon as possible. Numerous studies have been performed on the on the stability of COVID-19 virus in different environmental conditions including temperature and humidity. In this study, we aimed to discuss in detail the benefits and effects of these factors on COVID-19. Some studies have confirmed the relationship between environmental conditions and disease transmission and others have rejected. Furthermore, not all COVID-19 exposed people are infected and not all infected patients develop severe respiratory complications. It is quite likely that these disparities are genetically mediated, in part. People who may be occupationally exposed to this virus may be due to different reasons, including lack of health, lack of knowledge and attitude, and working conditions. Reducing human-to-human contact by increasing the level of public health in the community as well as maintaining social distance plays a key role in prevention of COVID-19 disease. However, many aspects of COVID-19 are still unknown and require further and extensive studies.","references_count":53,"scholarly_citations_count":2,"start_page":"250","end_page":"257","scholarly_citations":["036-608-059-703-934","081-374-381-125-274"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

first cluster of patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified on December 21, 2019, and as of July 29, 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been linked with 664,333 deaths and number at least 16,932,996 worldwide. Unprecedented in global societal impact, the COVID-19 pandemic has tested local, national, and international preparedness for viral outbreaks to the limits. Just as it will be vital to identify missed opportunities and improve contingency planning for future outbreaks, we must also highlight key successes and build on them. Concomitant to the emergence of a novel viral disease, there is a 'research and development gap' that poses a threat to the overall pace and quality of outbreak response during its most crucial early phase. Here, we outline key components of an adequate research response to novel viral outbreaks using the example of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the exceptional recent progress made in fundamental science, resulting in the fastest scientific response to a major infectious disease outbreak or pandemic. We underline the vital role of the international research community, from the implementation of diagnostics and contact tracing procedures to the collective search for vaccines and antiviral therapies, sustained by unique information sharing efforts.","references_count":60,"scholarly_citations_count":16,"start_page":"e1008902","scholarly_citations":["004-487-564-281-729","017-515-815-862-470","021-417-339-057-029","023-269-660-205-594","026-374-350-158-925","029-667-816-015-116","070-980-932-445-583","074-601-580-688-591","079-350-115-197-293","096-322-145-709-622","110-282-205-743-817","123-301-157-216-205","131-552-395-566-354","151-564-945-431-758","168-708-585-627-905","188-087-590-284-827"],"author_count":9,"is_open_access":true}

The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16 + years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed. FINDINGS: Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","references_count":19,"scholarly_citations_count":205,"start_page":"7789","end_page":"7798","scholarly_citations":["001-142-947-320-550","001-735-920-547-150","001-806-071-379-142","001-828-642-683-525","002-008-301-826-607","002-218-879-614-577","002-643-953-200-397","002-785-096-081-963","004-075-439-244-40X","004-235-326-526-97X","005-239-671-985-127","005-302-339-470-606","006-468-757-543-894","006-726-803-566-931","006-847-290-352-09X","007-106-909-147-128","007-179-946-093-71X","007-564-629-297-744","007-915-101-332-814","007-920-414-548-17X","008-427-844-370-25X","009-350-076-901-452","009-701-271-533-722","009-862-913-874-594","010-044-240-169-460","010-501-727-904-798","011-570-446-648-949","012-441-023-165-991","013-072-347-884-955","013-618-787-949-080","013-731-913-058-954","014-403-799-360-386","014-739-834-699-131","014-840-986-318-875","015-363-701-576-510","015-941-377-803-823","016-399-508-247-951","016-401-291-377-818","017-462-806-486-171","017-634-417-327-909","017-884-714-464-688","017-957-154-164-162","018-513-127-837-746","018-909-141-314-184","019-080-132-694-212","019-493-728-027-31X","020-279-499-878-150","020-953-042-049-303","021-015-456-489-259","021-421-435-100-033","021-776-217-904-95X","022-057-353-477-185","022-120-038-633-773","022-319-267-216-533","022-391-907-700-339","022-458-265-393-640","022-752-118-288-397","023-378-948-973-122","023-460-371-576-474","023-764-694-387-662","024-104-791-186-689","024-277-705-317-917","024-409-903-623-220","025-302-786-241-245","029-053-444-989-369","029-379-463-196-84X","029-507-661-631-199","029-518-209-492-229","029-679-492-122-326","029-838-880-326-916","030-091-669-146-701","032-959-208-598-410","033-547-562-971-80X","033-602-186-234-10X","033-832-172-478-916","033-926-356-763-794","033-975-035-527-871","035-058-490-780-304","035-271-030-963-962","035-398-653-808-879","037-409-848-229-141","037-754-863-936-992","038-001-681-248-742","038-009-975-927-771","038-482-991-542-71X","039-403-207-735-613","039-648-824-915-543","041-226-487-679-907","042-062-812-260-324","043-199-925-494-163","043-247-043-189-283","043-844-781-630-769","044-243-392-875-765","045-861-627-552-27X","046-149-475-494-417","046-294-951-933-339","047-691-227-019-154","048-316-366-071-122","049-817-181-125-149","052-031-055-878-741","053-076-028-144-828","053-279-967-324-771","053-315-143-536-160","053-500-780-837-876","054-031-402-394-032","054-072-835-053-904","055-115-310-535-293","055-272-095-177-25X","055-949-238-640-929","056-462-133-603-103","058-018-757-500-585","058-438-002-450-998","058-612-771-131-810","059-004-505-585-18X","059-591-798-586-897","060-770-154-736-123","060-812-632-929-29X","063-009-696-151-583","063-018-354-616-373","063-572-689-697-88X","063-941-073-985-446","067-063-134-325-986","068-669-112-601-41X","070-470-698-615-678","070-868-270-614-64X","071-932-623-530-573","073-019-340-708-477","073-500-777-420-223","074-299-951-378-732","075-475-857-737-248","075-971-597-088-300","076-563-227-041-496","076-835-082-123-146","077-302-823-180-215","078-185-613-221-329","079-504-171-976-514","080-622-863-154-354","082-574-090-322-983","083-822-796-178-633","084-446-952-868-389","084-907-158-445-257","085-525-438-171-10X","086-539-359-638-035","087-859-907-169-110","088-685-621-915-009","090-580-623-301-132","091-716-716-963-705","094-907-944-406-952","097-668-115-881-880","098-166-229-243-357","098-326-548-626-929","098-624-581-644-235","099-196-463-520-547","099-398-503-206-110","103-041-893-454-283","103-374-278-858-679","103-652-584-864-468","104-196-389-134-363","105-128-510-934-103","106-906-014-485-26X","107-112-123-894-240","107-700-005-010-855","109-080-196-303-236","109-352-737-735-813","109-443-755-123-179","112-845-539-676-553","114-400-558-460-759","117-323-878-377-949","121-780-594-121-560","121-785-780-407-813","121-870-522-223-76X","125-358-070-906-289","126-628-522-231-82X","129-566-893-642-837","132-750-562-807-906","133-831-015-907-95X","134-782-845-132-733","137-309-665-152-695","138-307-642-822-585","139-242-665-060-079","141-996-162-508-997","143-430-034-800-942","143-832-848-802-754","148-693-499-169-819","149-695-440-286-995","150-838-418-944-85X","156-424-528-650-201","157-449-459-376-938","159-551-430-360-952","159-720-013-417-828","162-486-198-531-12X","163-272-376-447-741","163-938-038-079-235","164-037-726-573-219","164-844-276-773-432","166-549-307-829-533","168-032-522-798-726","169-665-817-200-716","171-603-962-036-308","179-335-230-231-514","180-071-800-496-565","181-038-949-467-879","182-035-163-471-334","190-009-435-615-372","191-277-599-945-930"],"author_count":5,"is_open_access":true}

2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak could result in higher levels of psychological distress, especially among people suffering from pre-existing mental health conditions. Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency. Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.","references_count":29,"scholarly_citations_count":193,"start_page":"341","scholarly_citations":["000-148-032-324-976","000-175-143-190-150","000-669-186-431-911","001-722-591-061-99X","001-826-607-640-563","001-990-741-531-645","002-415-359-015-629","002-879-274-066-377","004-151-615-743-147","005-098-780-073-024","005-634-073-091-027","006-175-390-269-585","006-715-927-861-373","006-793-293-560-264","007-938-217-332-869","008-592-300-560-505","008-867-887-241-844","009-374-683-280-543","010-120-810-509-730","010-212-870-224-938","010-684-301-059-595","011-443-943-951-875","012-219-743-600-835","012-486-078-703-565","013-581-589-210-190","013-996-650-191-342","014-357-018-076-936","014-564-289-188-042","014-868-149-740-07X","015-183-198-456-109","015-184-275-552-212","015-239-608-850-070","015-975-348-858-329","016-406-745-759-283","016-535-439-246-085","016-748-760-522-399","017-530-014-130-54X","018-618-232-211-56X","019-169-558-128-841","019-178-101-862-59X","019-292-416-556-836","019-303-791-255-227","019-554-777-663-298","020-049-896-751-897","020-314-270-085-460","020-657-164-963-359","021-534-750-655-590","022-191-672-252-722","023-092-001-116-386","023-858-085-951-819","024-154-596-719-481","024-200-053-760-01X","024-648-807-500-026","025-376-063-213-314","025-552-270-925-138","025-850-177-361-003","026-443-806-858-628","027-394-036-932-745","028-000-772-885-336","028-050-616-042-172","028-114-657-972-94X","029-320-679-767-940","029-653-871-957-571","030-698-148-729-03X","031-401-225-309-503","032-036-895-444-361","032-775-215-634-516","033-198-678-184-397","033-988-108-262-142","035-128-264-836-606","035-185-799-088-983","035-229-964-532-710","035-417-205-095-212","036-667-252-771-832","036-787-345-345-214","037-301-519-263-256","038-767-965-085-382","039-980-447-681-773","040-467-620-077-296","040-728-325-794-156","040-839-373-395-442","041-101-342-701-326","041-224-979-244-310","042-431-075-144-331","044-999-185-588-35X","045-579-684-368-605","045-634-687-504-675","046-477-611-510-104","047-674-460-405-727","047-760-075-420-382","048-310-103-918-689","048-739-210-164-511","048-861-034-316-668","049-605-749-844-142","050-423-411-707-042","050-503-505-544-360","051-237-226-921-546","051-628-113-077-340","052-034-153-299-579","052-132-797-996-360","052-380-531-471-56X","052-584-898-692-654","053-085-154-404-98X","053-239-100-637-98X","053-419-715-274-546","053-692-419-254-53X","053-801-295-482-118","054-940-833-690-739","055-959-328-589-740","056-618-780-948-392","058-829-168-044-71X","058-981-748-529-875","060-885-098-732-100","061-236-460-630-008","061-865-126-434-433","063-498-079-228-784","063-781-890-548-22X","064-515-462-342-473","066-305-166-208-111","066-469-370-261-754","067-661-440-197-345","067-715-213-141-318","068-373-593-918-043","070-835-192-764-966","072-053-296-506-677","073-887-148-807-619","074-811-131-084-771","075-962-532-184-284","076-068-438-762-981","076-101-699-279-359","078-057-859-075-230","080-720-578-264-721","082-204-138-902-381","085-615-253-945-411","085-681-452-984-734","087-876-607-859-130","088-052-641-283-088","091-980-966-551-749","092-965-892-070-66X","099-921-511-073-948","101-596-663-307-460","103-006-700-168-480","103-707-284-180-22X","103-816-077-989-723","108-122-854-098-69X","108-864-507-338-970","111-466-181-016-174","111-966-793-455-910","116-190-872-033-931","116-472-539-083-236","116-941-364-375-606","117-748-919-898-972","119-294-536-387-680","119-978-813-576-568","119-991-987-838-499","120-539-912-749-736","122-216-034-885-430","122-822-016-274-572","123-739-574-475-722","127-325-378-415-592","128-302-166-116-819","128-692-270-574-445","128-713-316-601-462","131-258-737-729-823","131-434-352-783-132","131-732-356-057-301","132-593-935-957-565","135-825-349-364-774","137-482-130-504-753","139-311-349-749-647","139-946-719-882-015","145-940-111-012-855","146-433-654-965-521","149-163-393-425-747","151-413-031-393-697","153-847-062-574-029","159-517-326-285-092","160-340-805-064-005","164-323-085-464-182","164-647-598-010-208","166-236-110-091-849","167-117-734-623-377","170-488-966-886-476","174-862-671-910-670","175-057-063-956-944","178-286-684-617-628","178-594-882-984-028","180-687-769-214-480","182-638-863-118-489","186-515-951-603-519","190-124-199-645-388","191-010-083-670-646","196-972-250-428-777"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-COVID-19 patients in many hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.","references_count":50,"scholarly_citations_count":7,"start_page":"8084","end_page":"8104","scholarly_citations":["005-407-519-870-35X","021-364-114-474-466","022-323-563-700-890","088-488-570-377-729","123-280-396-084-81X","141-416-925-795-100","171-284-532-240-83X"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

These comments should stimulate a more diffused, efficient, and efficacious management of COVID-19 patients, also reducing the number of admissions to hospital emergency departments and the related spread of the infection.","references_count":18,"scholarly_citations_count":10,"start_page":"117","end_page":"119","scholarly_citations":["011-245-562-416-492","027-990-593-266-782","030-385-674-539-079","036-345-345-970-10X","052-049-943-199-873","055-725-839-206-279","056-200-774-892-179","075-790-378-186-952","083-542-651-871-932","125-491-234-592-03X"],"author_count":8,"is_open_access":true}

The authors also highlight that while some interventions provide short-term economic relief to the poor and small businesses, other interventions and gaps in the policy response have the potential for significant negative impact on businesses, households and unemployment. In addition, the authors highlight the potential for long-term benefits to the health sector and for private sector engagement in corporate responsibility and philanthropy.,The authors present a comprehensive account of the Nigerian government's budgetary response to the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic and social implications of this response.","references_count":11,"scholarly_citations_count":22,"start_page":"919","end_page":"928","scholarly_citations":["001-520-099-887-33X","004-021-632-869-504","005-000-556-413-612","015-773-450-196-143","020-992-864-175-124","034-039-498-244-741","035-346-568-217-826","035-402-787-425-143","037-130-574-952-720","060-867-231-731-678","062-865-554-043-11X","071-659-959-661-820","073-325-754-951-536","077-850-064-576-370","078-986-125-488-016","092-248-149-021-739","097-760-606-383-458","107-931-686-678-84X","112-021-812-443-696","146-561-776-092-518","147-145-671-965-443","185-217-822-150-400"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

identification of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is highly important to control the disease; however, the clinical presentation is often unspecific and a large portion of the patients develop mild or no symptoms at all. For this reason, there is an emphasis on evaluating diagnostic tools for screening. Chest CT scans are emerging as a useful tool in the diagnostic process of viral pneumonia cases associated with COVID-19. This review examines the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 in its various phases was compared using RT-PCR as a gold standard. A “reverse calculation approach” was applied and treated chest CT as a hypothetical gold standard and compared RT-PCR to it point out the flaw of the standard approach. High sensitivity (67–100%) and relatively low specificity (25–80%) was reported for the CT scans. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was reported to be modest (53–88%), hence cannot serve as an appropriate ground truth. The “reverse calculation approach” showed that CT could have a higher specificity (83–100%) if we consider the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 and the radiation exposure have to be judged together. Arguments are presented that chest CT scans have added value in diagnosing COVID-19 especially in patients, who exhibit typical clinical symptoms and have negative RT-PCR results in highly infected regions. • CT scans have higher specificity if we take into account the low sensitivity of the RT-PCR.\n • Avoid chest CT as a sole diagnostic approach for COVID-19 infection.\n • Patients who had negative RT-PCR result with typical clinical symptoms in highly infected regions or with close contact of COVID-19-infected patients; the use of chest CT is warranted.","references_count":24,"scholarly_citations_count":70,"start_page":"2819","end_page":"2824","scholarly_citations":["000-000-840-712-941","000-195-194-308-196","000-925-944-325-908","001-093-888-016-306","009-697-106-721-157","010-037-753-003-989","010-832-553-992-906","011-059-788-940-140","012-261-904-914-149","015-470-802-480-140","016-571-548-585-455","016-666-080-629-062","016-746-644-902-133","017-756-691-465-015","018-271-531-857-141","020-494-666-539-482","021-986-037-278-483","023-632-473-288-973","024-994-958-009-500","025-067-215-424-710","025-377-047-297-209","025-481-031-897-568","026-761-829-995-792","028-188-206-483-938","030-285-143-681-406","032-269-437-553-584","036-126-698-832-730","040-270-159-780-186","044-643-991-772-437","044-848-397-167-532","045-203-694-142-153","048-026-999-866-480","049-599-806-429-087","052-323-883-838-686","054-658-897-293-354","057-750-066-343-251","059-360-192-758-916","060-095-285-623-309","060-321-131-247-980","061-718-106-982-854","062-233-852-720-320","064-610-595-433-999","066-297-809-140-476","067-058-478-405-633","068-779-881-145-217","070-745-013-939-857","071-173-287-120-211","071-813-436-569-139","077-914-474-470-739","090-545-639-371-190","090-722-844-614-352","097-098-589-093-42X","098-587-696-620-110","101-605-903-181-767","101-902-935-992-450","103-819-803-340-982","104-854-661-909-722","108-333-348-698-983","110-308-664-472-246","110-576-942-320-05X","120-573-401-138-473","123-773-347-423-921","137-371-717-243-52X","143-448-700-853-663","144-158-509-620-010","147-047-418-835-304","149-207-916-787-782","149-730-749-123-896","161-995-628-390-937","164-617-886-027-111"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

Health Security Index (GHSI) and Joint External Evaluation (JEE) are two well-known health security and related capability indices. We hypothesised that countries with higher GHSI or JEE scores would have detected their first COVID-19 case earlier, and would experience lower mortality outcome compared to countries with lower scores. We evaluated the effectiveness of GHSI and JEE in predicting countries' COVID-19 detection response times and mortality outcome (deaths/million). We used two different outcomes for the evaluation: (i) detection response time, the duration of time to the first confirmed case detection (from 31st December 2019 to 20th February 2020 when every country's first case was linked to travel from China) and (ii) mortality outcome (deaths/million) until 11th March and 1st July 2020, respectively. We interpreted the detection response time alongside previously published relative risk of the importation of COVID-19 cases from China. We performed multiple linear regression and negative binomial regression analysis to evaluate how these indices predicted the actual outcome. The two indices, GHSI and JEE were strongly correlated (r = 0.82), indicating a good agreement between them. However, both GHSI (r = 0.31) and JEE (r = 0.37) had a poor correlation with countries' COVID-19–related mortality outcome. Higher risk of importation of COVID-19 from China for a given country was negatively correlated with the time taken to detect the first case in that country (adjusted R2 = 0.63–0.66), while the GHSI and JEE had minimal predictive value. In the negative binomial regression model, countries' mortality outcome was strongly predicted by the percentage of the population aged 65 and above (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.21) while overall GHSI score (IRR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.98–1.01)) and JEE (IRR: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96–1.02)) were not significant predictors. GHSI and JEE had lower predictive value for detection response time and mortality outcome due to COVID-19. We suggest introduction of a population healthiness parameter, to address demographic and comorbidity vulnerabilities, and reappraisal of the ranking system and methods used to obtain the index based on experience gained from this pandemic.","references_count":15,"scholarly_citations_count":35,"start_page":"e210","scholarly_citations":["001-101-346-177-137","004-104-974-074-908","004-382-987-975-115","004-868-677-540-028","005-700-790-003-854","007-296-309-330-674","009-088-169-244-665","009-585-327-879-031","011-315-046-565-759","012-442-006-685-316","013-065-504-650-357","014-006-266-545-346","018-213-504-843-62X","021-744-150-525-173","039-827-801-585-581","041-174-328-530-302","045-245-979-876-965","046-415-313-070-08X","047-255-845-673-03X","048-979-283-316-400","048-988-643-757-600","051-560-469-584-126","053-037-263-694-908","067-912-881-978-001","072-605-174-116-868","076-479-488-238-877","077-725-550-457-462","105-848-459-083-82X","107-706-851-858-852","109-086-893-615-099","141-305-548-270-349","144-541-511-826-087","145-756-069-235-43X","145-882-792-301-413","160-005-386-677-721"],"author_count":11,"is_open_access":true}

Despite the large amount of clinical data available of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), not many studies have been conducted about the psychological toll on Health Care Workers (HCWs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicentric descriptive study, surveys were distributed among 4 different Breast Cancer Centers (BCC). BCCs were distinguished according to COVID-19 tertiary care hospital (COVID/No-COVID) and district prevalence (DP) (High vs. Low). DASS-21 score, PSS score and demographic data (age, sex, work) were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 51 HCWs were analyzed in the study. Age, work and sex did not demonstrate statistically significant values. Statistically significant distribution was found between DASS-21-stress score and COVID/No-COVID (p=0.043). No difference was found in the remaining DASS-21 and PSS scores, dividing the HCWs according to COVID-19-hospital and DP. CONCLUSION: Working in a COVID-19-hospital represents a factor that negatively affects psychosocial well-being. However, DP seems not to affect the psychosocial well-being of BCC HCWs. During the outbreak, psychological support for low risk HCWs should be provided regardless DP.","references_count":36,"scholarly_citations_count":20,"start_page":"1685","end_page":"1694","scholarly_citations":["002-642-588-517-956","006-042-040-887-464","008-434-352-134-715","012-366-602-982-85X","013-965-595-074-204","016-145-473-019-253","018-658-712-250-310","021-104-031-766-411","025-307-567-403-622","035-708-894-389-493","042-759-834-823-159","048-110-303-097-735","069-735-116-681-575","073-530-453-969-778","074-746-943-555-796","075-497-911-948-730","088-717-077-948-870","088-812-683-215-488","128-028-081-418-499","169-939-852-497-506"],"author_count":26,"is_open_access":true}

COVID-19 has spread worldwide, to many Asian and Middle Eastern countries, the United Statesof America, and European countries. The current COVID-19 pandemic that has devastated Indonesia, has infected and killed more healthcare workers, in particular doctors and nurses, than any other outbreak in the history of this virus. People have basic needs that must be met for them to feel safe and secure. A history of the outbreak of the COVID-19 is brifley showed, before exploring the impact the virus had in Indonesia. During this exploration, some of the key issues arising from the experiences in Indonesia, in addressing the threat of COVID-19 will be reviewed. Drawing on the COVID-19 as the case study, we consider the ways in which the concept of human security expands understanding of its relationship to health. Further, weshow how major public health issues can evolve into security threats.The final section of the article will be an analysis of the lessons learned from COVID-19 and policy implications in addressing health and human security threats.","scholarly_citations_count":6,"scholarly_citations":["010-518-630-931-088","030-854-681-962-747","089-926-752-643-980","104-458-166-661-526","133-848-107-292-498","176-475-416-415-528"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

are rare cancers with a spectrum of clinical needs and outcomes. We investigated care experiences and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in sarcoma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with appointments during the first two months of the UK lockdown were invited to complete a survey. Questions included views on care modifications, COVID-19 worry and psychosocial impact, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 items. 350 patients completed the survey; median age 58 (16-92) years. Care modifications included telemedicine (74%) and postponement of appointments (34%), scans (34%) or treatment (10%). Most felt the quality of care was not affected (72%), however, social life (87%) and emotional wellbeing (41%) were affected. Worry about COVID-19 infection was moderately high (mean 5.8/10) and significantly related to higher cancer-related worry; associated with lower emotional functioning irrespective of treatment intent. Curative patients (44%) with low resilient coping scores had significantly higher COVID-19 worry. Patients who did not know their treatment intent (22%) had significantly higher COVID-19 worry and insomnia. In summary, care experiences were generally positive; however, cancer-related worry, low resilient coping and uncertainty about treatment intent were associated with COVID-19 worry. These patients may benefit from additional psychological support during the pandemic and beyond.","references_count":53,"scholarly_citations_count":29,"start_page":"2288","scholarly_citations":["002-657-125-890-289","005-514-296-697-791","007-981-245-412-886","010-089-071-952-276","010-109-532-001-381","015-797-330-717-481","017-019-670-534-050","021-752-009-923-420","023-578-495-308-774","024-655-314-976-777","026-139-714-193-984","029-832-243-833-694","033-941-440-205-555","044-165-802-784-540","059-434-931-770-425","065-877-542-039-065","066-586-566-582-755","067-227-285-560-789","067-925-815-333-62X","077-306-525-952-836","082-485-074-724-697","094-393-910-666-267","095-135-079-419-271","096-629-325-948-934","115-413-259-069-492","123-758-608-286-73X","125-083-296-710-844","145-285-891-865-681","148-754-221-979-346"],"author_count":19,"is_open_access":true}

people have paid a huge toll in terms of mortality during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Frailty may have contributed to the vulnerability of older people to more severe clinical presentation. We aimed at reviewing available evidence about frailty and COVID-19. We searched PUBMED, Web of Science, and EMBASE from 1 December 2019 to 29 May 2020. Study selection and data extraction were performed by three independent reviewers. Qualitative synthesis was conducted and quantitative data extracted when available. Forty papers were included: 13 editorials, 15 recommendations/guidelines, 3 reviews, 1 clinical trial, 6 observational studies, 2 case reports. Editorials and reviews underlined the potential clinical relevance of assessing frailty among older patients with COVID-19. However, frailty was only investigated in regards to its association with overall mortality, hospital contagion, intensive care unit admission rates, and disease phenotypes in the few observational studies retrieved. Specific interventions in relation to frailty or its impact on COVID-19 treatments have not been evaluated yet. Even with such limited evidence, clinical recommendations on the use of frailty tools have been proposed to support decision making about escalation plan. Ongoing initiatives are expected to improve knowledge of COVID-19 interaction with frailty and to promote patient-centered approaches.","references_count":51,"scholarly_citations_count":63,"start_page":"2106","scholarly_citations":["001-533-975-849-273","003-446-227-509-481","004-684-975-797-888","005-709-654-645-773","010-581-866-654-71X","010-861-733-851-396","011-297-826-776-817","015-291-947-648-721","016-818-171-243-763","019-232-950-791-524","019-456-993-802-53X","020-981-496-201-590","023-115-551-001-873","023-169-416-968-567","024-135-810-161-308","025-688-583-096-572","026-209-968-139-161","028-795-300-959-431","029-936-698-619-535","032-208-819-318-505","032-307-911-163-992","032-605-387-646-212","036-915-449-170-125","037-134-343-069-146","039-562-395-887-523","040-019-402-431-796","044-562-975-409-035","052-287-710-603-891","052-573-523-125-967","052-713-281-173-094","053-053-883-132-498","055-492-270-811-356","055-707-344-741-49X","063-112-761-633-024","063-224-880-533-911","063-386-102-693-945","063-850-587-834-406","064-321-191-796-952","064-998-074-799-016","065-613-246-867-000","065-765-542-750-651","067-228-257-626-319","067-942-874-884-063","069-867-027-505-363","073-606-177-803-496","075-917-883-741-924","085-598-527-539-727","086-940-442-213-143","089-468-283-462-611","089-877-960-782-24X","092-878-967-832-804","098-653-974-554-866","099-192-013-307-96X","103-429-897-483-672","110-013-984-461-062","113-278-510-183-542","114-900-245-242-786","115-405-427-872-437","116-336-954-032-35X","117-665-535-034-485","123-835-967-475-862","137-573-988-149-610","150-035-765-114-544"],"author_count":7,"is_open_access":true}

We examine the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting relaxations of pension regulations on pension schemes. Those who transfer their pension or withdraw cash from their pension pot while asset prices are depressed by COVID-19 are losers; as are members of defined benefit schemes with a deficit whose employer fails due to COVID-19. The increased mortality from COVID-19 will have a minimal effect on pensions. If economies recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, the long run effects on pensions should be small.","author_count":1,"is_open_access":true}

During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19.

We sought to describe the presentation, course, and outcomes of hospitalized pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 patients, with detailed description of those requiring mechanical ventilation, and comparisons between critically ill and noncritical hospitalized pediatric patients. Design Observational cohort study. Setting Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis in the early weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Patients All hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 as of May 4, 2020, were included. Interventions Patients received therapies including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum and were managed according to an institutional algorithm based on evidence available at the time of presentation. Measurements and main results Of 407 children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 at our hospital, 24 were positive, and 19 required hospitalization. Seven (36.8%) were critically ill in ICU, and four (21%) required mechanical ventilation. Hospitalized children were predominantly male (14, 74%) and African-American or Hispanic (14, 74%), with a bimodal distribution of ages among young children less than or equal to 2 years old (8, 42%) and older adolescents ages 15-18 (6, 32%). Five of seven (71.4%) of critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2). Critical illness was associated with older age (p = 0.017), longer duration of symptoms (p = 0.036), and lower oxygen saturation on presentation (p = 0.016); with more thrombocytopenia (p = 0.015); higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.031); and lower WBC count (p = 0.039). Duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 14.1 days. One patient died. Conclusions Severe, protracted coronavirus disease 2019 is seen in pediatric patients, including those without significant comorbidities. We observed a greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation than has been reported to date. Older children, African-American or Hispanic children, and males may be at risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring hospitalization. Hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein may be useful markers of critical illness. Data regarding optimal management and therapies for pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed.","references_count":15,"scholarly_citations_count":24,"start_page":"e948","end_page":"e953","scholarly_citations":["001-041-093-539-256","005-867-534-383-282","006-941-736-412-298","007-032-898-302-997","010-863-731-258-07X","011-567-792-397-989","026-052-754-891-005","031-334-214-568-561","033-334-854-413-35X","035-071-920-912-191","045-730-774-177-641","049-865-489-051-71X","050-555-867-739-629","055-719-022-511-956","056-840-015-495-784","061-304-453-697-513","063-823-570-377-831","065-429-657-533-427","078-311-174-298-74X","078-498-772-858-412","085-759-068-294-365","090-206-385-552-795","097-668-461-106-713","167-065-321-103-275"],"author_count":7,"is_open_access":true}

Literature search revealed that there is very little formal evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant, labouring and postnatal women or their babies. The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short- and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.","references_count":26,"scholarly_citations_count":19,"scholarly_citations":["006-581-228-688-232","013-741-995-606-369","017-377-940-912-294","020-243-623-127-764","036-948-165-375-891","045-208-178-534-858","046-267-745-623-205","048-695-884-236-823","049-149-283-515-77X","051-012-087-651-242","051-475-574-296-699","055-128-598-584-301","057-595-244-125-71X","067-263-492-957-015","074-466-661-638-482","092-184-750-261-207","095-336-072-168-802","104-020-152-129-583","163-502-229-623-531"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

As of July 26, 2020, 16258353 COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including 649848 deaths. The spread of COVID-19 is currently very high. Under the classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, epidemiological data for India up to 26th July 2020 were used to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak. For controlling the spreading of the virus, we have to prepare for precaution and futuristic calculation for infection spreading. We used the data from the COVID-2019 Outbreak of India on July 26th, 2020 in this report. In these results, for the initial level of experimental intent, we used 16291331 susceptible cases, 481248 infectious cases, and 910298 rewards / removed cases. Through the aid of the SIR model, data on a wide range of infectious diseases have been analyzed.  SIR model is one of the most effective models which can predict the spreading rate of the virus. The findings of the SIR model can be used to forecast transmission and avoid the outbreak of COVID-2019 in India. The results of the study will shed light on understanding the outbreak patterns and indicate those regions epidemiological points. Finally, from this study, we have found that the outbreak of the COVID-2019 epidemic in India will be at its peak on 09 August 2020 and after that, it will work slowly and on the verge of ending in the second or third week of November 2020.","references_count":12,"start_page":"09","end_page":"18","author_count":1,"is_open_access":true}

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is likely to be significant. Identifying vulnerable groups during the pandemic is essential for targeting psychological support, and in preparation for any second wave or future pandemic. Vulnerable groups are likely to vary across different societies; therefore, research needs to be conducted at a national and international level. This online survey explored generalized anxiety and depression symptoms in a community sample of adults (N = 1,039) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between April 8th and April 22nd, 2020. Respondents completed symptom measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7), along with psychosocial and demographic variables that might potentially influence such symptoms. Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for the main study variables. Levels of anxiety and depression were notably higher than those reported in previous (pre-pandemic) national studies. Similar variables were statistically significantly associated with both depression and anxiety, most notably younger age, being female, having a history of mental health problems, self or loved ones testing positive for COVID-19, and having high levels of COVID-related anxiety and economic threat. Sections of the UAE population experienced relatively high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic. Several COVID-related and psychosocial variables were associated with heightened symptomatology. Identifying such vulnerable groups can help inform the public mental health response to the current and future pandemics.","references_count":41,"scholarly_citations_count":10,"start_page":"564172","end_page":"564172","scholarly_citations":["000-152-245-815-252","009-141-573-349-856","009-203-228-923-141","059-985-851-744-316","061-195-433-704-632","084-897-908-927-444","098-240-877-785-413","100-639-717-567-817","107-856-411-032-858","191-524-133-752-577"],"author_count":10,"is_open_access":true}

To report the surveillance of COVID-19 pandemic in Chile and analyse the response to public health interventions implemented from 3 March to 30 June 2020 and to assess the risks of collapse of the health care system. Methods: We analysed the effective reproductive number, underreporting of cases, burden of critical beds, case fatality ratio and number of diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: After an accelerated onset, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be relatively controlled in Chile (late April 2020), with reproductive numbers close to 1.00. However, at this time, the load of infected patients was high, with an important number of underreported cases; the diagnostic effort was still limited and heterogeneous across regions. After 1 May up to 30 June a marked exponential increase in the number of cases was observed with a peak on June 14. In this last period the occupation of intensive care unit beds increased to saturation level (89% nationally; 95% in the Metropolitan Region). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the implemented public health interventions have been initially effective in decreasing the spread of the pandemic. Premature decisions to relax these interventions may have resulted in a rebound in cases with a rapid saturation of the health care system.","references_count":20,"scholarly_citations_count":22,"start_page":"1","scholarly_citations":["001-070-529-118-755","005-584-367-593-986","006-406-755-719-602","008-109-117-835-993","013-089-059-022-892","019-758-418-131-366","021-274-519-330-314","025-573-150-073-308","030-495-759-710-370","037-050-380-755-032","051-174-544-209-487","055-889-008-643-938","071-936-437-250-541","073-551-696-935-313","078-369-154-476-977","079-669-280-182-428","095-326-696-330-442","105-058-815-407-258","146-893-109-723-460","146-944-475-065-805","167-614-081-682-27X","185-060-380-511-404"],"author_count":10,"is_open_access":true}

It is known that COVID-19 may exhibit a vast range of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure are the most common causes of death in COVID-19 cases [3]. Accumulating evidence shows that T-helper type (Th-1) inflammation cascade plays a major role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It is proposed that aberrant immune reaction, or known as cytokine storm, is one of the main causals of ARDS in COVID-19 case, while dupilumab, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved immunomodulatory treatment for atopic dermatitis, is known for its effectiveness in suppressing the Th-2 inflammation pathway. It is postulated that both types of inflammation can cross-regulate each other. Therefore, some may believe that the regression of Th-2 cascade may upregulate the Th-1 cascade, leading to an exaggerated cytokine storm. This hypothesis leads to the uncertainty of the safety of continuing this modality during the pandemic.","references_count":53,"start_page":"399","end_page":"407","author_count":1,"is_open_access":true}

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) causing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) continues to be widespread in Kansas.  County health departments are trying to contain this pandemic. \nMethods. This second survey of Kansas county health department directors occurred from August 7 to September 7, 2020.  Since the first survey in April, there have been significant increases in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 and related deaths.  Thus, the aim of the study was to re-evaluate county-level containment efforts and assess shortfalls that were previously identified in the April 2020 survey.\nResults. In total, 41 out of 105 directors responded to the survey.  Generally, respondents said there were increased supplies for testing, increased testing centers, shorter time to get test results, and in some cases, increased funding.  However, the number of people involved in contact tracing had not substantially increased, which was one of the recommended changes for improving containment.  Moreover, of those persons who were tested, only a few (18%) counties inquired if they wear masks in public.  From comments reported, there was a sense of employees being overwhelmed, especially among the smaller county health departments.\nConclusions. As the cases of and deaths from COVID-19 are increasing in the state, especially in high density areas, the respondents to our survey indicate there is continued need for additional  funding with easy access, increased staffing, especially for contact tracing, and significant help for effective messaging to improve adherence to public health directives.","references_count":16,"scholarly_citations_count":1,"start_page":"290","end_page":"299","scholarly_citations":["026-818-266-804-79X"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

This study is to seek an answer to these two research questions: 1. What is the effect of the COVID-19 virus on Tourism Attraction in Yogyakarta? 2. Is the impact of the COVID-19 virus on Tourism attractions in Yogyakarta has a more severe impact than an earthquake in 2006? From the results of this study, it was found that COVID-19 is more dangerous than earthquakes, particularly in the economy sector.

Recent research has shown that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected to 6–8 meters away,2 even further than the range of ‘social distance’.3 Preponderance of evidence has indicated that mask wearing reduced the transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts, and public mask wearing played the most effective role in stopping the spread of the virus.4 5 Thus, more countries such as the USA and the UK are reassessing their public health recommendations on wearing face masks.\n\nCOVID-19 is a ‘cunning disease’.6 First, due to its high level of contagiousness, many virus carriers are spreading the virus for several days before showing any observable symptoms.7 It is hard to identify those patients who look healthy but are actually highly contagious.\n\nSecond, COVID-19 is hidden and difficult to detect.

Due to the sudden closure of schools, students are missing social interaction which is vital for better learning and grooming while most schools have started online classes. This has become a tough routine for the parents working online at home since they have to ensure their children’s education. The study presented was designed to explore the experiences of home learning in times of COVID-19. A descriptive qualitative study was planned to explore the experiences of parents about home learning and management during COVID-19 to get an insight into real-life experiences.  Purposive sampling technique was used for data collection.  Data were collected from 19 parents falling in the inclusion criteria. Considering the lockdown problem, the data were collected via Google docs form with open-ended questions related to COVID-19 and home learning. Three major themes emerged after the data analysis: impact of COVID on children learning; support given by schools; and strategies used by caregivers at home to support learning. It was analyzed that the entire nation and academicians around the world have come forward to support learning at home offering a wide range of free online avenues to support parents to facilitate home-learning. Furthermore, parents too have adapted quickly to address the learning gap that have emerged in their children’s learning in these challenging times. Measures should be adopted to provide essential learning skills to children at home. Centralized data dashboards and educational technology may be used to keep the students, parents and schools updated.","references_count":5,"scholarly_citations_count":53,"start_page":"9","end_page":"26","scholarly_citations":["002-535-894-264-682","004-797-079-399-591","006-703-467-807-940","007-247-777-352-929","009-486-492-148-650","010-678-781-950-641","014-405-833-004-115","017-245-731-075-157","020-121-313-047-704","023-123-714-112-122","023-336-677-821-77X","026-370-456-907-797","027-193-488-542-261","027-963-532-617-207","028-109-909-730-247","028-678-348-532-135","033-496-517-618-276","040-870-479-689-516","041-405-037-136-992","042-012-778-589-381","044-538-423-717-283","048-586-314-169-750","052-769-202-224-344","053-172-242-142-807","054-727-615-469-11X","054-862-371-729-967","056-903-611-123-86X","056-936-625-089-341","061-602-468-581-164","063-713-270-107-98X","065-756-660-280-625","073-606-207-593-419","075-415-034-215-743","076-755-466-961-771","088-745-325-711-919","089-774-860-815-276","107-353-314-210-259","112-391-130-837-91X","113-100-128-666-932","115-277-632-002-146","122-683-910-740-139","123-340-482-375-340","128-417-253-575-992","129-547-575-865-29X","130-972-020-604-988","138-425-386-232-566","138-877-072-646-552","143-501-242-556-257","145-952-439-088-421","155-229-486-671-273","167-194-407-619-820","167-543-451-404-862","177-028-673-207-721"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.","references_count":17,"scholarly_citations_count":28,"start_page":"963","end_page":"963","scholarly_citations":["004-178-078-786-976","004-477-594-568-49X","004-849-725-479-839","009-433-288-567-349","009-642-043-885-489","010-988-680-132-045","013-689-608-606-882","025-410-915-904-665","032-080-966-791-300","037-071-655-621-256","049-226-971-209-721","051-281-262-869-878","054-483-513-768-09X","058-360-604-648-128","062-745-102-967-374","067-433-184-348-399","070-881-408-492-275","078-071-447-897-300","078-472-784-599-467","081-246-606-077-191","081-498-685-655-877","113-280-869-635-376","115-636-626-730-130","119-309-308-540-988","127-041-571-880-440","130-229-873-967-210","162-546-421-871-883","199-953-077-831-794"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

This was an online cross-sectional study among dwellers of southwest Nigeria. Data were collected online with kobo toolbox and analyzed using descriptive statistics, test of independence and binary logistic regression. Of the 286 study participants, 96.1% had good knowledge, 99.3% had positive attitude towards control of COVID-19, while 77.3% had good practices for prevention of the virus. Majority of the participants (86.9%) had tertiary education, 11.3% were 40years or older. Age and education were independently associated with COVID-19 prevention practice. After adjustment for some selected socio-demographic factors, only age of 10 – 19 years (OR: 3.83, CI: 1.05, 14), age 20-29 years (OR: 2.99, CI: 1.18 -7.55), and 30 -39 years (OR: 4.35, CI: 1.49-12.67) were more likely to have good practice of COVID-19 prevention compared to age &gt;=40 years. The result revealed a high prevalence of good practices, and majority had good knowledge of COVID-19 and positive attitude towards control of COVID-19. Age and education were identified to be associated with practice of COVID-19 prevention. While further exploration revealed that elders (&gt;=40years) were not likely to have good practice of COVID-19 prevention. We deduced that good practice of COVID-19 prevention was high in southwest Nigeria but notably low among elders and those who attained below tertiary education in southwest Nigeria. However, people of older age and poor education should be given much attention for proper enlightening and prevention strategies in this pandemic.</jats:p>","references_count":9,"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

The majority are over 85, have multiple health conditions, live with frailty and are nearing the end of their lives.  Up to 80% of residents live with dementia.  Care homes are not part of the National Health Service (NHS).  Care home places are funded through a complex mix of self-funding, means-tested support from local authorities, and continuous healthcare funding from the NHS.  They are run by independent organisations. A third of providers are large for-profit chains, the remainder comprising not-for-profit third-sector organisations, or small private companies with only a small number of homes.  The level of government reimbursement for long-term care homes in the UK is low by international standards, an issue highlighted by multiple public commissions3,4 but which has gone unaddressed by successive UK governments.\r\n\r\nMedical care to UK care homes is highly variable.  In some areas, the NHS Care Home Vanguards have established dedicated General Practitioners with responsibility for each home and direct access to specialist multidisciplinary teams, with evidence that such approaches may minimise unnecessary admission to hospital5.  But often, care is based on residents’ individual relationships with family doctors, with the result that access to medical care is variable and uncoordinated6.  As the COVID -19 pandemic started, arrangements for medical care in English care homes were in the early stages of being standardised as part of the NHS England Enhanced Health in Care Homes project.\r\n\r\nThere is a social dread surrounding care homes, perceived as places to avoid because of concerns about care quality and resistance to having to pay for social care when health care is free. Most of the coverage of care homes in mainstream media prior to COVID was negative, focussing on isolated scandalous cases of negligence or abuse, and rarely reporting on the exceptional work done by the sector daily.  The workforce is not valued. There is no national accreditation for care home staff, opportunities for career progression are limited, staff are poorly paid and positions in care homes are often referred to as unskilled work","author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}

editorial reports on an anonymous survey question posed to eating disorders researchers about changes the International Journal of Eating Disorders (IJED) should implement to support the eating disorders research community affected by COVID-19. The editorial accompanies an IJED article that details responses to the larger survey focusing more broadly on COVID-19-related research disruptions. Survey invitations were sent to editorial board members of eating disorders journals, members of eating disorder scientific organizations (e.g., Eating Disorders Research Society), and individuals who provided at least three IJED reviews in the prior 12 months. We reviewed the responses of 187 participants and identified three categories of changes that: (a) had already been implemented by the journal, (b) cannot be implemented because they fall outside the scope of IJED, or (c) will be implemented in coming weeks or months. The latter category includes publishing topical COVID-19 papers, making some COVID-19-related content available open access, revising statistical guidelines, and issuing author guidance on reporting protocol changes caused by COVID-19-related disruptions. IJED recognizes the disruptive impacts that COVID-19 has on all activities in our field, including clinical work, teaching, and advocacy, and is committed to supporting authors during this difficult time while striving to publish high-quality research.","references_count":6,"scholarly_citations_count":3,"start_page":"1017","end_page":"1020","scholarly_citations":["012-907-048-153-294","038-065-559-958-647","047-641-264-656-165"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common, and can range from the presence of proteinuria and haematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT; also known as kidney replacement therapy). COVID-19-associated AKI (COVID-19 AKI) is associated with high mortality and serves as an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. The pathophysiology and mechanisms of AKI in patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated and seem to be multifactorial, in keeping with the pathophysiology of AKI in other patients who are critically ill. Little is known about the prevention and management of COVID-19 AKI. The emergence of regional 'surges' in COVID-19 cases can limit hospital resources, including dialysis availability and supplies; thus, careful daily assessment of available resources is needed.

The Aviation Sector, Pharmaceutical Sector, Tourism and Hotel Sector and Entertainment Sector are studied and analyzed individually and includes current information related to their industry, analyzing the economic impact of COVID – 19 on these sectors in India along with suggestions for these sectors to grow again and improve themselves. The main objective of this report is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian Economy and these 4 sectors. The research done is a secondary research as the data available online through research papers, online articles and industry reports were sufficient for the research, and also during the current pandemic, primary research wasn’t possible. The research involved data from various sources including articles from sources like LiveMint, Economic Times and India Today and The Wire and also articles by Pharmaceutical Technology, Brand Equity, BW Hotelier, etc. Industry reports by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation and Deloitte. The report by Deloitte was specific to the pharmaceutical sector and the effect of COVID- 19 on the sector. The industry reports by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation gave an idea about a standard condition of the sector in the country and who all are the market leaders. Data from the Government of India Website and FICCI website and articles were also taken to get authentic insights about the situation. The results show us that even though the pharmaceutical sector had some problems they are still growing and television and online media and entertainment are growing in the entertainment sector but the Cinema Halls are closed. The aviation sector had been hit very badly due to the airports all around the world being shut but with time some flights everyday are opened for urgent purposes with a lot of precautions and maybe till the end of the year they get back to their original state. The tourism and hospitality sector has been hit the worst. This was one of the last sectors being allowed by the government to open in the lockdown transition. The restaurants need to follow strict social distancing norms and various preventions to maintain sanitation and have been allowed to open from 8th June. This sector will comparatively take a lot of time to recover as the rule given by the Government to not allow more than 50 people in a social gathering can cause losses to this sector. As the government has started relaxing norms, it is expected that with time these sectors will be able to recover their losses and the economy will come back on track with the growth of technology and the aim of the country to become self-sufficient.</jats:p>","scholarly_citations_count":1,"scholarly_citations":["007-270-525-509-307"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19 identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the performanceson both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.","references_count":50,"scholarly_citations_count":69,"start_page":"2806","end_page":"2813","scholarly_citations":["000-195-813-277-772","001-070-653-830-58X","003-017-224-608-454","007-348-468-616-911","008-215-390-727-933","008-674-190-837-532","011-480-838-938-508","011-728-494-308-030","012-181-043-275-874","014-464-226-705-075","014-781-113-330-675","015-696-383-664-982","018-357-976-126-031","018-937-511-958-744","019-609-094-609-757","020-035-018-449-056","021-103-061-733-077","024-621-499-698-287","025-377-047-297-209","026-247-210-629-05X","026-721-937-081-932","028-001-224-830-275","029-827-425-197-717","030-722-833-982-815","032-045-983-705-749","033-024-830-707-587","034-363-557-791-791","035-739-863-178-679","036-422-982-166-647","036-847-184-045-537","036-879-995-282-137","038-514-109-027-862","042-144-231-900-88X","043-278-668-146-584","045-203-694-142-153","048-982-470-352-201","049-283-007-125-967","054-140-461-450-156","054-480-725-422-345","056-719-938-851-21X","060-095-963-150-898","061-686-529-996-832","062-979-133-529-619","067-093-866-539-047","075-764-799-086-66X","076-782-974-591-563","077-404-105-189-925","080-789-834-200-192","082-488-929-622-658","086-331-770-457-899","086-378-223-558-875","096-166-201-368-040","099-414-194-512-145","100-759-414-504-911","104-795-202-014-025","110-379-295-329-775","115-357-514-732-404","117-373-149-050-642","118-146-804-312-861","121-923-002-460-75X","122-994-671-272-777","123-784-362-626-712","134-857-202-988-785","135-715-275-598-924","139-961-393-933-083","140-027-918-129-956","146-352-541-909-297","165-363-647-103-93X","181-975-276-997-416"],"author_count":3,"is_open_access":true}

Over 50 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally as of November 2020. Evidence is rapidly emerging on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and its impact on individuals and potential burden on health services and society. Between 10-35% of people with COVID-19 may experience post-acute long Covid. This currently equates to between 8,129 and 28,453 people in Scotland. Some of these people will require rehabilitation to support their recovery. Currently, we do not know how to optimally configure community rehabilitation services for people with long Covid. Methods: This national survey aimed to provide a detailed description of current community rehabilitation provision for people with long Covid in Scotland. We developed, piloted, and conducted a national electronic survey of current community rehabilitation service provision for people presenting with long Covid symptomatology. Our sample were the Allied Health Professions Directors of all 14 territorial NHS Health Boards in Scotland. Fixed response and narrative data were analysed descriptively. Results: Responses were received from all respondents (14/14), enabling a national picture to be gained. Almost all Health Boards (13/14) currently deliver rehabilitation for people with long Covid within pre-existing services. Fatigue (11/14) and respiratory conditions (9/14) were the two most common presenting problems of patients. Most long Covid community rehabilitation services are delivered through a combination of face-to-face and digital contact (13/14). Conclusions: Community rehabilitation for people with long Covid is an emerging reality. This survey provides a national picture of current community rehabilitation for people with long Covid. We do not know how community rehabilitation can be optimally delivered for this population. This is vital as community rehabilitation services were already under pressure prior to the emergence of COVID-19. Further research is urgently required to investigate the implementation, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of differing models of community rehabilitation for this patient population.","references_count":13,"scholarly_citations_count":4,"start_page":"1416","end_page":"1416","scholarly_citations":["021-430-253-962-446","040-500-270-333-086","046-988-373-752-945","187-307-134-733-209"],"author_count":6,"is_open_access":true}

Methods: In a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study we compared and correlated 17 epidemiologic, health care system-related and health-economic factors from medical databases and intergovernmental organisations potentially influencing the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 publication productivity between 1 January and 30 April 2020 amongst the 30 countries most severely affected by the pandemic. These factors were additionally correlated with the national pre-COVID-19 publication rate for the same pre-year period to identify potential changes in the general publication behaviour. Findings: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 publication rates correlated strongest with access to and quality of health care (ρ = 0.80 and 0.87, p < 0.0001), COVID-19 cases per capita (ρ = 0.78 and 0.72, p < 0.0001), GDP per capita (ρ = 0.69 and 0.76, p < 0.0001), health spending per capita (ρ = 0.61 and 0.73, p < 0.0001) and the pre-COVID-19 Hirsch-Index (ρ = 0.61 and 0.62, p = 0.002 and <0.0001). Ratios of publication rates for “Cancer”, “Diabetes” and “Stroke” in 2020 versus the pre-year period were 0.88 ± 0.06, 1.02 ± 0.18 and 0.9 ± 0.20, resulting in a pooled ratio of 0.93 ± 0.06 for non-COVID-19 publications. Interpretation: There are marked geographic and national differences in publication productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both COVID-19- and non-COVID-19 publication productivity correlates with epidemiologic, health care system-related and healtheconomic factors, and pre-COVID publication expertise. Countries with a stable scientific infrastructure appear to maintain non-COVID-19 publication productivity nearly at the pre-year level and at the same time use their resilience to produce COVID-19 publications at high rates.","references_count":15,"scholarly_citations_count":12,"start_page":"271","scholarly_citations":["011-157-414-738-246","016-723-198-222-653","019-377-435-421-710","024-366-850-200-891","029-895-742-227-582","033-445-999-257-281","055-004-165-410-782","058-114-436-332-090","064-410-306-052-035","072-797-097-338-158","112-823-418-721-699","169-528-397-808-926"],"author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}

COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has far-reaching direct and indirect medical consequences. These include both the course and treatment of diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that infections with SARS-CoV-2 can cause considerable immunological alterations, which particularly also affect pathogenetically and/or therapeutically relevant factors. Against this background we summarize here the current state of knowledge on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 with mediators of the acute phase of inflammation (TNF, IL-1, IL-6), type 1 and type 17 immune responses (IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, IL-36), type 2 immune reactions (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, IgE), B-cell immunity, checkpoint regulators (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4), and orally druggable signaling pathways (JAK, PDE4, calcineurin). In addition, we discuss in this context non-specific immune modulation by glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, antimalarial drugs, azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil and fumaric acid esters, as well as neutrophil granulocyte-mediated innate immune mechanisms. From these recent findings we derive possible implications for the therapeutic modulation of said immunological mechanisms in connection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Although, of course, the greatest care should be taken with patients with immunologically mediated diseases or immunomodulating therapies, it appears that many treatments can also be carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic; some even appear to alleviate COVID-19.","references_count":125,"scholarly_citations_count":32,"start_page":"795","end_page":"807","scholarly_citations":["000-122-186-665-68X","001-005-631-149-40X","002-296-358-489-081","002-628-188-852-527","006-516-399-329-858","007-616-428-611-161","011-420-035-599-843","011-887-850-972-201","013-751-970-086-175","021-744-881-736-871","026-284-802-501-474","027-679-078-378-411","031-545-383-667-552","035-341-805-358-778","039-832-448-884-703","039-869-147-716-182","042-456-889-786-473","050-464-229-696-595","053-500-335-236-941","054-937-231-495-680","057-572-866-540-705","059-670-590-731-915","060-235-025-430-318","068-959-648-509-625","073-076-519-423-309","076-551-084-193-549","079-421-326-072-920","092-008-055-572-414","096-019-075-977-207","102-753-750-131-312","152-975-683-376-455","189-572-637-305-53X"],"author_count":16,"is_open_access":true}

To identify risk factors associated with\r\na worse outcome of COVID-19, a nationwide registry was developed for patients with cancer\r\nand COVID-19.\r\nMethods: This observational cohort study has been designed as a quality of care registry and is\r\nexecuted by the Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium (DOCC), a nationwide collaboration of oncology physicians in the Netherlands. A questionnaire has been developed to collect\r\npseudonymised patient data on patients’ characteristics, cancer diagnosis and treatment. All\r\npatients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis or treatment in the past 5 years are eligible.\r\nResults: Between March 27th and May 4th, 442 patients were registered. For this first analysis,\r\n351 patients were included of whom 114 patients died. In multivariable analyses, age 65\r\nyears (p < 0.001), male gender (p Z 0.035), prior or other malignancy (p Z 0.045) and active\r\ndiagnosis of haematological malignancy (p Z 0.046) or lung cancer (p Z 0.003) were independent risk factors for a fatal outcome of COVID-19. In a subgroup analysis of patients with\r\nactive malignancy, the risk for a fatal outcome was mainly determined by tumour type (haematological malignancy or lung cancer) and age (65 years).\r\nConclusion: The findings in this registry indicate that patients with a haematological malignancy or lung cancer have an increased risk of a worse outcome of COVID-19. During the\r\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these vulnerable patients should avoid exposure to severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas treatment adjustments and prioritising vaccination, when available, should also be considered","references_count":23,"scholarly_citations_count":45,"start_page":"171","end_page":"184","scholarly_citations":["000-633-986-303-569","002-241-200-460-838","002-384-635-693-081","003-490-773-701-532","005-558-188-907-258","008-735-545-703-258","011-281-417-416-080","011-546-920-474-73X","013-809-322-080-41X","014-651-386-758-700","019-326-794-356-658","020-108-938-234-669","021-526-941-939-617","021-961-552-912-919","022-799-105-687-514","024-156-379-087-35X","025-727-821-127-143","027-729-381-397-378","029-287-240-144-227","030-202-905-713-579","030-541-167-279-075","043-791-165-705-222","046-160-421-871-368","052-048-907-668-594","054-293-533-664-688","055-856-053-123-578","064-744-550-459-742","066-390-166-175-830","075-507-373-333-283","081-752-749-468-925","087-650-963-932-005","094-049-840-460-892","096-244-724-732-033","098-184-225-097-080","100-523-849-796-799","104-572-305-151-382","107-643-252-636-865","108-096-591-181-443","109-087-874-257-921","114-132-773-146-123","127-792-728-885-23X","133-416-021-391-410","137-730-572-492-331","160-169-426-121-383","191-937-202-604-208"],"author_count":82,"is_open_access":true}

develop recommendations for the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A task force comprising of 25 rheumatologists from the 5 regions of the continent was formed and operated through a hub-and-spoke model with a central working committee (CWC) and 4 subgroups. The subgroups championed separate scopes of the clinical questions and formulated preliminary statements of recommendations which were processed centrally in the CWC. The CWC and each subgroup met by several virtual meetings, and two rounds of voting were conducted on the drafted statements of recommendations. Votes were online-delivered and recommendations were pruned down according to predefined criteria. Each statement was rated between 1 and 9 with 1–3, 4–6 and 7–9 representing disagreement, uncertainty and agreement, respectively. The levels of agreement on the statements were stratified as low, moderate or high according to the spread of votes. A statement was retired if it had a mean vote below 7 or a ‘low’ level of agreement. A total of 126 initial statements of recommendations were drafted, and these were reduced to 22 after the two rounds of voting. The preliminary statements of recommendations will serve to guide the clinical practice of rheumatology across Africa amidst the changing practices and uncertainties in the current era of COVID-19.

order to control the spread of COVID-19, people must adopt preventive behaviours that can affect their day-to-day life. People’s self-efficacy to adopt preventive behaviours to avoid COVID-19 contagion and spread should be studied. The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the COVID-19 prevention, detection, and home-management self-efficacy scale (COVID-19-SES). We conducted an observational cross-sectional study. Six-hundred and seventy-eight people participated in the study. Data were collected between March and May 2020. The COVID-19-SES’ validity (content, criterion, and construct), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability), and legibility were studied. The COVID-19-SES’ reliability was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.906; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.754). The COVID-19-SES showed good content validity (scale’s content validity index = 0.92) and good criterion validity when the participants’ results on the COVID-19-SES were compared to their general self-efficacy (r = 0.38; p < 0.001). Construct validity analysis revealed that the COVID-19-SES’ three-factor structure explained 52.12% of the variance found and it was congruent with the World Health Organisation’s recommendations to prevent COVID-19 contagion and spread. Legibility analysis showed that the COVID-19-SES is easy to read and understand by laypeople. The COVID-19-SES is a psychometrically robust instrument that allows for a valid and reliable assessment of people’s self-efficacy in preventing, detecting symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19.","references_count":37,"scholarly_citations_count":11,"start_page":"4653","scholarly_citations":["009-297-128-517-453","028-522-788-690-46X","028-627-182-128-860","041-266-967-791-240","044-356-694-968-116","045-432-835-897-074","051-975-570-875-512","080-805-399-528-683","088-498-193-673-854","150-720-288-281-707","176-757-672-832-027"],"author_count":8,"is_open_access":true}

The intersecting effects of power hierarchies and identities affect women's paid, unpaid, and underpaid labor—particularly their role in providing care—during COVID-19. This includes women's labor in the home, women's roles in the health and social care sectors, and women's role in informal, precarious work including domestic work.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of women's care labor is unequivocal: globally, women are responsible for the majority (76.2%) of unpaid care work, spending an average of 201 days on unpaid work during a year, compared to 63 days spent on unpaid work by men (International Labour Organization, 2018a). Worldwide, the International Labour Organization (2020a) reports that of the 136 million workers in the health and social care sectors, 70% are women. Around 80% of the world's domestic workers are women (International Labour Organization, 2018b). Migrant domestic workers in particular face additional challenges due to their often-uncertain legal status and limited labor rights.\r\n\r\nWomen's labor during COVID-19 occurs in a context where structural discrimination already shapes who lives and dies (Chotiner, 2020): racism, gender inequality and unequal and dangerous work have long been linked to adverse health outcomes (Krieger and Smith, 2004). Women's experiences in the workplace are shaped by intersections between gender, age, race, class and migration status (Sheppard, 2011; International Labour Organization, 2020b). These intersections shape who benefits—or suffers—as a result of economic policies, including austerity measures (Bassel and Emejulu, 2014), especially during COVID-19 (Craddock, 2020). The International Labour Organization (2020c) recommendations on the labor market impacts of COVID-19 highlight the combined effects of job losses in hard-hit sectors, women's overrepresentation in the health sector, and higher demands on care labor at home. More recent policy briefs outline the importance of intersectionality in understanding how pre-existing discrimination based on gender and ethnicity in the workplace are exacerbated during COVID-19, particularly in the health and the informal sectors. However, such data are rarely available in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)—further entrenching the invisibility of women's labor. A blindness toward inequalities perpetuates narratives that COVID-19 is “a great equalizer” (Evelyn, 2020). Similarly, reports of men dying at higher rates often fail to specify “which men?,” nor ask “compared to which women?.” Current analyses are thus limited in their ability to critically reflect on power and inequality—which we hope to address in this opinion piece.\r\n\r\nWe examine three types of women's labor during COVID-19—their care labor at home, labor in health and social care sector, and labor within informal and precarious domestic work. To date, the academic literature on COVID-19 has not addressed these issues using an intersectional lens, particularly for LMICs. For each type of work, we use a feminist political economy lens to explore how women's labor and care work are included or excluded in COVID-19 responses. Such an approach offers a critical analysis of how gender inequality may be sustained through neoliberal economics (Peterson, 2005), and how gender intersects with other power hierarchies and identities such as race and class (Agenjo-Calderon and Galvez-Munoz, 2019). It challenges how the economic system perpetuates intersecting inequalities, including how labor is distributed, how labor is valued, and who benefits from the economy and who does not—emphasizing how economic policies are not gender-neutral (Pearson, 2019). We examine emerging evidence on women's labor, highlighting the limitations of COVID-19 responses that do not consider intersections between race, gender and class. We conclude by highlighting concrete steps to ensure protections for women whose labor—and health—are both produced and affected by intersections of race, gender, and class.","references_count":14,"scholarly_citations_count":9,"start_page":"588279","end_page":"588279","scholarly_citations":["022-668-393-532-428","036-762-599-920-003","044-000-268-386-327","070-603-911-795-281","087-628-337-607-087","113-387-608-401-854","126-376-318-985-335","169-649-044-094-666","175-206-748-729-548"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

Slowing down economic activities, transportation, restrictions of the human public gatherings, and interaction resulted with a tremendous decline in air pollutant concentration especially in nitrogen dioxide, registered by National Aeronautics and Space Administration and European Space Agency satellites.\r\nAIM: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown conditions on the air quality in selected cities in Macedonia.\r\nMETHODS: Daily mean concentration of the particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide measured in the national air quality monitoring network, was analyzed separately comparing following periods: past week of February 2020 to the end of May 2020 with the same period in 2017–2019. Depending on the data distribution, parametric independent-samples t-test or nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test was run to determine if there were differences in the pollutants concentration during the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 period.\r\nRESULTS: Implementation of strict restrictions of the movement along with reduced economic activities and vehicular transport, led to notable decrement of air pollutant concentrations. We have found an evident decrease in the concentration levels of all pollutants measured during COVID-19 period in 2020, compared to those from 2017 to 2019 with exceptions for PM2.5 in Kumanovo and carbon monoxide in Skopje (7% and 3% higher concentration). The most notable decrement was for NO2, with a concentration 5–31% lower during COVID-19 period.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Although beneficial to human health, there is a need to assess economic implications of the lockdown that could have a negative impact on the health as well.","references_count":20,"scholarly_citations_count":1,"start_page":"353","end_page":"362","scholarly_citations":["025-355-007-661-486"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

A state of global pandemic was shortly declared among a very rapid contagious spread of the virus. The causative virus was identified as the SARS-CoV-2 viruses and is genetically related to the previous SARS outbreak in 2003. The virus causes a wide clinical spectrum from mild flu-like symptoms to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Kidney involvement has been reported in several reports in patients with various degrees of severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As knowledge is evolving, the accurate incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is not known. Many questions are yet to be answered regarding the effect of epidemiological variables and comorbidities on the occurrence of AKI. Some reports have observed the occurrence of hematuria and proteinuria in a percentage of infected patients. Moreover, chronic kidney disease has not been found, in some reports to add to the adverse outcomes, an aspect that merits further exploration. Patients on regular hemodialysis may be vulnerable to coronavirus infection due to the lower status of immunity and the need for frequent attendance at health-care facilities. Due to the previous factors, prevention and mitigation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in this vulnerable population, constitutes a major challenge.","references_count":27,"scholarly_citations_count":1,"start_page":"103","end_page":"107","scholarly_citations":["035-671-916-796-924"],"author_count":1,"is_open_access":true}

Since early December 2019, COVID-19 emerged the Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The disease is still continuing spread to more than 200 countries and territories globally.\r\nAIM: This study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 among the surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera, Indonesia.\r\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020, among the surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera province, Indonesia. A set of validated, pre-tested questionnaire was used to measure knowledge regarding COVID-19 infection and to collect a range of explanatory variables. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. A two-step logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the association of participants’ demographic data, level of education, surveillance training, length of work, and location of workplace with the knowledge.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 246 participants were collected. We found that 109 out of 246 (44.3%) participants were good knowledge of COVID-19. Multivariate model revealed that surveillance training was the most associated variable with knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.09–4.27). In addition, as much as 27 participants (79.4%) have good knowledge and also have received surveillance training expressed a willingness to conduct surveillance (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = 1.98–11.39).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera regarding COVID-19 is relatively low. Participants who have good knowledge and have received surveillance training expressed a willingness to conduct surveillance of COVID-19 in the community. Therefore, training for surveillance and outbreak investigation team to improve the understanding and skill is a must.","references_count":15,"start_page":"55","end_page":"60","author_count":11,"is_open_access":true}

In addition, many believe that being able to spend more time at home is important when adopting a pet, and COVID-19 has allowed people this opportunity.  This study examines the adoption phenomena through an anthrozoological lens, and identifies the reasons behind this increase in animal adoption as well as the potential negative effects once the COVID crisis is over. If this increase in adoption will continue as people return to work remains to be seen, and experts question whether relinquishment and abandonment rates will skyrocket as the nation faces widespread unemployment and economic insecurity.</jats:p>","references_count":10,"scholarly_citations_count":4,"scholarly_citations":["019-676-831-400-727","046-829-127-246-23X","117-004-796-124-579","137-217-964-282-109"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, is challenging healthcare systems worldwide. Little is known about problems faced by emergency medical services—particularly helicopter services—caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. We aimed to describe the issues faced by air ambulance services in Europe as they transport potential COVID-19 patients. Nine different HEMS providers in seven different countries across Europe were invited to share their experiences and to report their data regarding the care, transport, and safety measures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 missions. Six air ambulance providers in six countries agreed and reported their data regarding development of special procedures and safety instructions in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic. Four providers agreed to provide mission related data. Three hundred eighty-five COVID-19-related missions were analysed, including 119 primary transport missions and 266 interfacility transport missions. All providers had developed special procedures and safety instructions in preparation for COVID-19. Ground transport was the preferred mode of transport in primary missions, whereas air transport was preferred for interfacility transport. In some countries the transport of COVID-19 patients by regular air ambulance services was avoided. Patients in interfacility transport missions had a significantly higher median (range) NACA Score 4 (2-5) compared with 3 (1-7), needed significantly more medical interventions, were significantly younger (59.6 ± 16 vs 65 ± 21 years), and were significantly more often male (73% vs 60.5%). All participating air ambulance providers were prepared for COVID-19. Safe care and transport of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is achievable. Most patients on primary missions were transported by ground. These patients were less sick than interfacility transport patients, for whom air transport was the preferred method.","references_count":22,"scholarly_citations_count":18,"start_page":"94","end_page":"94","scholarly_citations":["005-185-842-264-72X","009-451-099-421-091","017-303-317-863-783","019-843-095-813-78X","035-114-003-932-061","056-909-773-670-708","064-652-548-518-629","075-697-061-201-097","087-688-147-084-208","102-322-604-659-763","111-269-458-234-367","112-713-068-877-628","113-443-604-347-815","116-362-506-794-35X","131-791-431-620-951","144-712-555-757-654","166-558-580-499-226","184-204-882-005-214"],"author_count":11,"is_open_access":true}

Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding from computed tomography (CT) images of the chest. At present, there are no specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection for potential therapy of humans.

At present (up to July 11, 2020), 255,117 cases and 12,635 deaths due to this disease have been reported in Iran. Following the guidelines recommended for the prevention and control of the disease is the most important approach to combating this global threat.\r\nAIM: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of the Iranian people in relation to COVID-19.\r\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the participation of 558 Iranian people who entered the study by convenience sampling method. The knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of the Iranian general population toward COVID-19 were collected using an online 50-items questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, independent sample T-test, and bivariate Pearson’s correlation were used to analyze the data.\r\nRESULTS: The studied subjects were mostly in urban area (81.0%), female (61.3%), and married (57.9%). The participants’ knowledge about personal hygiene (88.9%), using a facemask (82.2%), and the symptoms of the COVID-19 (76.8%) were adequate. However, their knowledge about contaminated surfaces disinfection procedure (41.8%), and the importance of using a facemask for healthy people (43.7%) was lower. The highest level of the subjects’ attitude was related to the role of social distancing (94.6%), staying at home (94.5%), and personal hygiene (91.2%). The low levels of attitude were also associated with access to personal protective equipment (84.1%) and the psychological effects of COVID-19 (65.3%). Furthermore, the highest levels of practices were related to avoiding hand shaking with others (91.5%) and washing hands frequently (88.8%). The practices such as following a healthy and nutritious diet (45.1%) and wearing gloves (51.4%) were reported to be less common.\r\nCONCLUSION: The results showed that about half of the subjects did not have enough knowledge about COVID-19.

The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team.Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.","references_count":8,"scholarly_citations_count":15,"start_page":"44","end_page":"45","scholarly_citations":["003-912-855-820-217","012-538-863-214-451","017-849-168-967-291","020-592-590-510-307","023-603-292-328-216","027-406-052-631-569","042-556-209-175-993","051-740-493-371-938","054-687-406-200-516","054-970-940-958-638","065-587-067-252-207","076-811-237-845-738","135-517-488-838-904","149-655-003-413-531","179-833-974-596-358"],"author_count":2,"is_open_access":true}

Regional and speciality specific data is important to guide this decision-making process. This study aimed to review 30-day mortality for all patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the peak of the pandemic within our region. Methods This multicentre study reviewed data on all patients undergoing trauma and orthopaedic surgery in a region from 18 March 2020 to 27 April 2020. Information was collated from regional databases. Patients were COVID-19-positive if they had positive laboratory testing and/or imaging consistent with the infection. 30-day mortality was assessed for all patients. Secondly, 30-day mortality in fracture neck of femur patients was compared to the same time period in 2019. Results Overall, 496 operations were carried out in 484 patients. The overall 30-day mortality was 1.9%. Seven out of nine deceased patients underwent surgery for a fractured neck of femur. In all, 27 patients contracted COVID-19 in the peri-operative period; of these, four patients died within 30 days (14.8%). In addition, 21 of the 27 patients in this group had a fractured neck of femur, 22 were over the age of 70 years (81.5%). Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade > 3 and/or age > 75 years were at significantly higher risk of death if they contracted COVID-19 within the study period. Conclusion Overall 30-day postoperative mortality in trauma and orthopaedic surgery patients remains low at 1.9%. There was no 30-day mortality in patients ASA 1 or 2. Patients with significant comorbidities, increasing age, and ASA 3 or above remain at the highest risk. For patients with COVID-19 infection, postoperative 30-day mortality was 14.8%. The reintroduction of elective services should consider individual patient risk profile (including for ASA grade). Effective postoperative strategies should also be employed to try and reduce postoperative exposure to the virus.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:392-397.","references_count":17,"scholarly_citations_count":17,"start_page":"392","end_page":"397","scholarly_citations":["018-952-154-058-435","019-787-141-819-792","021-367-674-758-647","021-466-960-991-697","023-863-268-266-028","032-128-964-236-557","038-113-961-820-543","043-188-605-031-326","051-230-995-783-895","053-887-797-305-568","056-488-065-922-115","065-892-045-896-387","091-876-407-533-616","119-429-845-611-813","119-722-613-126-862","121-295-978-619-553","121-673-975-151-444"],"author_count":7,"is_open_access":true}

Despite related constraints, the Primary Health Cares (PHC) in Indonesia plays an important role in the face of emergency situations.\r\nAIM: This study aimed to review the dengue and COVID-19 infection, clinical manifestations in children and adults, clinical pathology findings, as well as the prevention strategies that could be applied in PHC.\r\nMETHODS: This study is a narrative review based on the research articles and reports that were published between 2010 and 2020. A total of 70 articles and reports were obtained and after careful consideration, 58 articles and reports were used as references of this study.\r\nRESULTS: Both dengue virus (DENV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV-2) share the similarity of antigenic structure, common symptoms, and laboratory findings. The immune response in SARS-CoV-2 may cause a cytokine storm, which can increase vascular permeability and organ damage. Secondary infection of DENV with different strains may allow the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement. The cross-reactions between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV antigens may cause false positive on rapid dengue infection serological tests.\r\nCONCLUSION: PHC as the front line of health services has a fundamental role in the crisis situation. The prevention and control of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are based on the mode of transmission and need compliance to the related health protocols.","references_count":34,"start_page":"391","end_page":"398","author_count":5,"is_open_access":true}

No study has yet examined the presence of psychiatric symptoms in the UK population in similar conditions.AimsWe investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 related anxiety, generalised anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms in a representative sample of the UK population during an early phase of the pandemic, and estimated associations with variables likely to influence these symptoms.MethodBetween March 23rd and March 28th 2020, a quota sample of 2025 UK adults 18 years and older, stratified by age, sex and household income, was recruited by online survey company Qualtrics. Participants completed measures of depression (PHQ9), generalised anxiety (GAD7), and trauma symptoms relating to the pandemic (ITQ). Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for age, gender, rural vs urban environment, presence of children in the household, income, loss of income, pre-existing health conditions in self and someone close, infection in self and someone close, and perceived risk of infection over the next month.ResultsHigher levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms were reported compared to previous population studies, but not dramatically so. Meeting the criteria for either anxiety or depression, and trauma symptoms was predicted by young age, presence of children in the home, and high estimates of personal risk. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also predicted by low income, loss of income, and pre-existing health conditions in self and other. Specific anxiety about COVID-19 was greater in older participants.Conclusions The UK population, especially older citizens, were largely resilient in the early stages of the pandemic. However, several specific COVID-related variables are associated with psychological distress: particularly having children at home, loss of income because of the pandemic, as well as having a pre-existing health condition, exposure to the virus and high estimates of personal risk. Further similar surveys, particularly of those with children at home,  are required as the pandemic progresses.</p>","scholarly_citations_count":48,"scholarly_citations":["000-363-112-265-293","003-333-985-383-338","003-415-305-261-097","004-318-602-929-809","004-402-767-436-182","008-230-973-826-314","011-913-782-431-345","015-852-236-026-413","016-667-319-404-709","016-732-702-968-695","022-651-760-248-496","022-790-146-860-191","023-048-525-168-373","023-845-642-192-227","026-897-018-993-075","027-395-319-812-107","030-043-143-683-944","031-009-494-070-792","032-314-099-327-188","032-323-211-373-593","034-117-783-853-432","041-565-527-582-517","044-493-403-902-16X","045-901-579-792-677","047-069-615-896-693","048-587-331-233-202","048-628-690-550-486","050-774-789-757-804","052-816-401-033-750","053-254-207-296-770","054-095-823-233-088","055-194-351-901-630","059-574-581-777-356","062-031-007-636-484","063-399-922-214-690","063-581-827-159-348","075-697-387-475-91X","081-537-163-970-844","083-286-125-057-009","092-600-379-178-854","092-639-822-459-940","095-471-091-299-05X","098-240-877-785-413","150-165-702-089-260","160-213-288-080-418","160-588-829-278-218","161-784-496-909-273","194-012-100-171-24X"],"author_count":14,"is_open_access":true}

paper collates the pathological findings from initial published autopsy reports on 23 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 5 centers in the United States of America, including 3 cases from Houston, Texas. Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with a diffuse alveolar damage component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extravascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in nonhemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the 3 Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 g heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 g heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 g heart). All 3 subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65, and 35.2 Kg/m2). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy.","references_count":98,"scholarly_citations_count":273,"start_page":"107233","end_page":"107233","scholarly_citations":["001-309-043-828-636","001-511-230-577-771","001-835-772-314-774","002-414-866-305-60X","002-558-518-620-956","002-579-761-733-902","002-980-214-976-818","003-053-009-680-910","004-010-157-900-731","004-102-063-788-222","004-471-755-001-594","004-697-898-682-990","004-956-507-601-107","004-984-439-151-375","005-309-801-556-760","005-543-521-055-510","005-865-520-478-724","006-113-131-204-10X","006-140-333-153-500","006-268-621-226-703","006-997-094-435-211","007-408-009-233-577","007-682-556-310-166","007-800-532-321-105","007-948-796-097-750","007-989-759-310-98X","008-246-989-693-866","008-354-561-122-606","008-686-636-586-247","008-697-193-190-553","008-728-717-651-525","009-587-581-168-242","009-672-605-601-589","009-842-314-105-111","010-523-075-931-754","010-578-473-877-704","010-782-515-567-578","011-879-623-417-195","012-045-246-280-888","012-131-666-247-209","012-810-555-215-786","013-405-190-447-388","013-539-577-128-019","013-581-113-422-884","013-777-523-272-916","013-836-145-801-565","014-299-843-106-151","015-611-328-225-260","015-620-597-716-441","015-731-752-198-552","016-090-431-208-659","016-155-789-962-562","016-280-405-813-668","016-695-540-079-86X","016-818-996-167-38X","016-875-210-671-690","017-099-999-024-796","017-212-088-759-478","018-271-531-857-141","018-789-738-382-952","019-064-517-861-755","019-185-207-757-961","019-238-433-914-802","019-345-914-569-046","019-943-987-327-435","020-252-742-179-166","020-349-262-057-54X","020-458-316-830-546","020-859-063-840-259","020-908-035-585-017","020-964-519-337-307","021-492-082-058-009","021-699-869-960-926","021-794-574-463-995","021-955-393-298-593","022-700-006-298-502","022-800-624-271-903","022-823-272-494-602","023-085-923-382-175","023-263-606-942-940","024-998-108-285-283","025-247-047-667-905","025-316-296-014-506","025-571-487-855-584","025-572-138-310-695","025-688-287-960-813","025-705-133-291-807","026-231-251-076-846","026-866-905-452-45X","027-026-174-456-936","027-087-442-305-499","027-468-879-322-805","028-153-882-586-078","028-649-034-218-642","029-460-982-664-383","030-976-906-343-759","031-148-615-805-928","031-493-248-208-802","031-553-576-833-14X","032-040-831-102-698","033-929-317-574-898","034-133-248-304-642","034-373-159-243-158","034-975-917-668-285","035-087-613-916-711","035-732-989-092-414","036-232-851-173-225","036-685-119-873-142","037-219-426-123-315","037-435-635-816-755","038-382-159-683-831","038-628-501-435-428","038-741-320-324-352","039-831-036-774-925","040-305-692-150-657","040-610-941-192-833","041-057-717-787-643","041-513-192-374-083","042-135-671-064-534","042-488-062-564-027","043-220-774-483-152","043-390-485-107-70X","044-542-471-859-229","044-651-261-458-008","045-099-624-060-024","045-334-158-215-89X","045-991-965-676-887","046-978-872-783-026","046-985-380-123-449","047-169-246-995-984","047-345-904-246-505","047-518-206-362-085","047-521-663-730-848","047-752-583-901-043","047-928-374-102-25X","048-068-034-524-455","048-408-157-904-405","048-714-644-642-508","049-386-815-403-103","049-679-827-022-446","050-165-420-528-901","050-315-961-891-499","051-474-377-848-955","051-690-777-793-566","052-442-368-499-183","052-494-346-082-621","052-863-982-432-363","053-587-654-693-538","053-618-468-589-154","054-298-227-265-761","054-618-996-067-524","054-656-347-613-131","054-677-204-455-968","054-900-051-964-17X","055-950-561-104-198","055-952-135-692-870","056-377-502-319-292","056-808-353-625-49X","056-894-567-318-499","058-141-451-167-12X","058-164-352-728-026","058-197-370-285-311","059-302-598-921-095","060-509-760-146-52X","061-432-247-429-127","061-957-273-339-047","062-007-943-380-071","063-205-583-722-624","063-560-870-926-650","064-567-409-188-352","064-931-832-647-411","065-501-700-170-304","065-857-873-689-363","066-152-209-040-992","066-330-985-046-923","066-950-132-897-950","067-051-807-934-295","067-119-655-374-740","067-197-551-895-449","067-441-621-927-576","068-779-881-145-217","069-091-614-192-925","069-637-550-469-885","070-910-985-456-602","071-106-768-975-886","071-192-379-189-981","071-259-326-553-069","072-122-610-768-496","072-302-550-878-930","073-061-256-339-92X","073-610-283-041-191","073-807-454-124-987","074-305-465-128-461","074-721-705-680-531","075-662-704-979-493","076-175-982-286-345","076-322-743-911-948","076-494-595-271-045","077-983-456-897-658","078-276-249-850-877","078-363-915-549-388","079-217-733-673-194","079-321-875-456-902","080-031-727-785-341","080-133-630-844-920","080-671-217-290-651","080-858-243-921-306","080-967-625-281-394","081-712-498-351-32X","081-794-834-451-744","081-942-885-436-108","081-945-036-514-435","083-439-844-300-399","083-762-722-304-260","084-402-499-820-015","084-599-674-628-592","084-857-824-894-108","084-927-415-458-437","085-124-780-067-159","085-250-029-982-77X","085-407-387-761-726","086

Coinfection is common in pediatric with COVID-19 infection. One of the most important transmission routes is oral feces. The severity of the disease was mild or asymptomatic in most children. The most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in children than in adults. Infants and preschoolers had more severe clinical symptoms than older children. The most common radiographic findings from the lungs were bilateral ground-glass opacity. Increased procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase should be considered in children. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and oseltamivir, along with oxygen therapy, had the greatest effect on improving children’s conditions.&#x0D;\nCONCLUSIONS: The most important way to prevent this disease in children is to follow the health tips of family members. Although the number of children with the disease is low, children are vulnerable to infection. Antiviral medications along with the use of muscle relaxants and oxygen therapy have a great impact on children’s condition.</jats:p>","scholarly_citations_count":5,"start_page":"23","end_page":"31","scholarly_citations":["005-760-707-411-852","033-334-854-413-35X","123-676-700-639-332","158-100-068-873-51X","167-065-321-103-275"],"author_count":4,"is_open_access":true}
